1
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,099
My second story is about love and loss.

2
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:14,329
I was lucky I found what I loved to do early in life.

3
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:17,919
Woz and I started Apple in my parents garage when I was 20.

4
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:21,659
We worked hard, and in 10 years Apple had grown from just the two of

5
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:25,979
us in a garage into a $2 billion company with over 4000 employees.

6
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:29,749
We had just released our finest creation the Macintosh

7
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:32,039
a year earlier, and I had just turned 30.

8
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:34,349
And then I got fired.

9
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:38,299
How can you get fired from a company you started?

10
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,299
Well, as Apple grew we hired someone who I thought

11
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:44,859
was very talented to run the company with me,

12
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:46,869
and for the first year or so things went well.

13
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:49,079
But then our visions of the future began

14
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:52,139
to diverge and eventually we had a falling out.

15
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:55,069
When we did, our Board of Directors sided with him.

16
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:59,129
So at 30 I was out. And very publicly out.

17
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:02,289
What had been the focus of my entire adult life was gone,

18
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:04,099
and it was devastating.

19
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:07,038
I really didn't know what to do for a few months.

20
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:10,269
I felt that I had let the previous generation of entrepreneurs

21
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:13,609
down - that I had dropped the baton as it was being passed to me.

22
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:16,889
I met with David Packard and Bob Noyce

23
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,099
and tried to apologize for screwing up so badly.

24
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:22,239
I was a very public failure,

25
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,489
and I even thought about running away from the valley.

26
00:01:24,970 --> 00:01:29,789
But something slowly began to dawn on me I still loved what I did.

27
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:34,199
The turn of events at Apple had not changed that one bit.

28
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:37,369
I had been rejected, but I was still in love.

29
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:40,239
And so I decided to start over.

30
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:44,309
I didn't see it then, but it turned out that getting fired from

31
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:46,719
Apple was the best thing that could have ever happened to me.

32
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:49,588
The heaviness of being successful was

33
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:52,424
replaced by the lightness of being a beginner again,

34
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:53,559
less sure about everything.

35
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:57,299
It freed me to enter one of the most creative periods of my life.

36
00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:00,749
During the next five years, I started a company named NeXT,

37
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:02,288
another company named Pixar,

38
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:05,479
and fell in love with an amazing woman who would become my wife.

39
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:09,009
Pixar went on to create the worlds first computer animated feature

40
00:02:09,010 --> 00:02:10,504
film, Toy Story,

41
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:16,379
and is now the most successful animation studio in the world.

42
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:20,199
In a remarkable turn of events, Apple bought NeXT,

43
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:23,109
I returned to Apple, and the technology we developed at

44
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:25,838
NeXT is at the heart of Apple's current renaissance.

45
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:29,179
And Laurene and I have a wonderful family together.

46
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:32,149
I'm pretty sure none of this would

47
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:34,149
have happened if I hadn't been fired from Apple.

48
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:38,288
It was awful tasting medicine, but I guess the patient needed it.

49
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:44,259
Sometimes life hits you in the head with a brick. Don't lose faith.

50
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:47,609
I'm convinced that the only thing that kept me going was that I loved

51
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:50,704
what I did. You've got to find what you love.

52
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:53,869
And that is as true for your work as it is for your lovers.

53
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:56,499
Your work is going to fill a large part of your life,

54
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,848
and the only way to be truly satisfied

55
00:02:58,850 --> 00:03:01,208
is to do what you believe is great work.

56
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:04,857
And the only way to do great work is to love what you do.

57
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:09,519
If you haven't found it yet, keep looking. Don't settle.

58
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:13,909
As with all matters of the heart, you'll know when you find it.

59
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:15,334
And, like any great relationship,

60
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:18,393
it just gets better and better as the years roll on.

61
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:22,549
So keep looking. Don't settle.

62
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:34,888
My third story is about death.

63
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:38,929
When I was 17, I read a quote that went something like:

64
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:42,154
"If you live each day as if it was your last,

65
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:44,368
someday you'll most certainly be right."

66
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:51,759
It made an impression on me, and since then, for the past 33 years,

67
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,539
I have looked in the mirror every morning

68
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:56,419
and asked myself: "If today were the last day of my life,

69
00:03:56,420 --> 00:04:00,118
would I want to do what I am about to do today?"

70
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:04,069
And whenever the answer has been "No" for too many days in a row,

71
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,959
I know I need to change something.

72
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:10,329
Remembering that I'll be dead soon is the most important

73
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:13,609
tool I've ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life.

74
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:19,114
Because almost everything all external expectations, all pride,

75
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:21,044
all fear of embarrassment or failure -

76
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:24,119
these things just fall away in the face of death,

77
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:26,679
leaving only what is truly important.

78
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:30,069
Remembering that you are going to die is the best

79
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:34,128
way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose.

80
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:38,969
You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart.

81
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:43,379
About a year ago I was diagnosed with cancer.

82
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:46,564
I had a scan at 7:30 in the morning,

83
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:49,469
and it clearly showed a tumor on my pancreas.

84
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,009
I didn't even know what a pancreas was.

85
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:54,939
The doctors told me this was almost

86
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:57,189
certainly a type of cancer that is incurable,

87
00:04:57,190 --> 00:05:01,469
and that I should expect to live no longer than three to six months.

88
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:06,469
My doctor advised me to go home and get my affairs in order,

89
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,309
which is doctor's code for prepare to die.

90
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:14,359
It means to try to tell your kids everything you thought

91
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:17,569
you'd have the next 10 years to tell them in just a few months.

92
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:20,149
It means to make sure everything is buttoned

93
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:23,109
up so that it will be as easy as possible for your family.

94
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:25,849
It means to say your goodbyes.

95
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:29,979
I lived with that diagnosis all day.

96
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:32,734
Later that evening I had a biopsy,

97
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:35,034
where they stuck an endoscope down my throat,

98
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:37,404
through my stomach and into my intestines,

99
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:40,879
put a needle into my pancreas and got a few cells from the tumor.

100
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:44,729
I was sedated, but my wife, who was there,

101
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:47,908
told me that when they viewed the cells under a microscope

102
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:50,899
the doctors started crying because it turned out to be

103
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:54,869
a very rare form of pancreatic cancer that is curable with surgery.

104
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:59,516
I had the surgery and thankfully I'm fine now.

105
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,704
This was the closest I've been to facing death,

106
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:12,839
and I hope its the closest I get for a few more decades.

107
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:14,519
Having lived through it,

108
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:17,649
I can now say this to you with a bit more certainty than when

109
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:21,718
death was a useful but purely intellectual concept:

110
00:06:21,819 --> 00:06:24,269
No one wants to die.

111
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:28,789
Even people who want to go to heaven don't want to die to get there.

112
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:32,219
And yet death is the destination we all share.

113
00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:36,574
No one has ever escaped it. And that is as it should be,

114
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:40,889
because Death is very likely the single best invention of Life.

115
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:42,984
It is Life's change agent.

116
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:45,449
It clears out the old to make way for the new.

117
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:50,879
Right now the new is you, but someday not too long from now,

118
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:54,159
you will gradually become the old and be cleared away.

119
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:57,407
Sorry to be so dramatic, but it is quite true.

120
00:06:58,549 --> 00:07:03,689
Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life.

121
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:06,809
Don't be trapped by dogma which is living

122
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:08,998
with the results of other people's thinking.

123
00:07:09,169 --> 00:07:12,589
Don't let the noise of others' opinions drown out your own inner

124
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:14,849
voice. And most important,

125
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:17,679
have the courage to follow your heart and intuition.

126
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:21,749
They somehow already know what you truly want to become.

127
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:24,599
Everything else is secondary.

128
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,309
When I was young,

129
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:41,484
there was an amazing publication called The Whole Earth Catalog,

130
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:44,189
which was one of the bibles of my generation.

131
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:48,169
It was created by a fellow named Stewart Brand not far from here

132
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:51,878
in Menlo Park, and he brought it to life with his poetic touch.

133
00:07:52,239 --> 00:07:53,989
This was in the late 1960's,

134
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:56,574
before personal computers and desktop publishing,

135
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:00,739
so it was all made with typewriters, scissors, and polaroid cameras.

136
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:03,339
It was sort of like Google in paperback form,

137
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:07,744
35 years before Google came along: it was idealistic,

138
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:10,949
overflowing with neat tools, and great notions.

139
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:13,489
Stewart and his team put out several

140
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:14,879
issues of The Whole Earth Catalog,

141
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:19,309
and then when it had run its course, they put out a final issue.

142
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:23,519
It was the mid-1970s, and I was your age.

143
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,829
On the back cover of their final issue

144
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:30,469
was a photograph of an early morning country road,

145
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,719
the kind you might find yourself

146
00:08:31,719 --> 00:08:34,589
hitchhiking on if you were so adventurous.

147
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:39,538
Beneath it were the words: "Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish."

148
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:44,629
It was their farewell message as they signed off. Stay Hungry.

149
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:49,128
Stay Foolish. And I have always wished that for myself.

150
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:54,939
And now, as you graduate to begin anew, I wish that for you.

151
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:58,008
Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish.

152
00:08:58,131 --> 00:09:01,253
Thank you all very much.
