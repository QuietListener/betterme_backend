4
00:00:22,492 --> 00:00:30,019
Thank You. I am honored to be with you today at your commencement

5
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:32,738
from one of the finest universities in the world.

6
00:00:35,559 --> 00:00:41,559
Truth be told I never graduated from college

7
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:45,929
and this is the closest I've ever gotten to a college graduation.

8
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:52,009
Today I want to tell you three stories from my life. That's it.

9
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:54,849
No big deal. Just three stories.

10
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:59,569
The first story is about connecting the dots.

11
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:03,894
I dropped out of Reed College after the first 6 months,

12
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:05,798
but then stayed around as a drop-in

13
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:08,728
for another 18 months or so before I really quit.

14
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:11,078
So why did I drop out?

15
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:14,369
It started before I was born.

16
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:19,034
My biological mother was a young, unwed graduate student,

17
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:21,348
and she decided to put me up for adoption.

18
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:26,228
She felt very strongly that I should be adopted by college graduates,

19
00:01:26,309 --> 00:01:28,608
so everything was all set for me to

20
00:01:28,609 --> 00:01:31,098
be adopted at birth by a lawyer and his wife.

21
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:34,149
Except that when I popped out they decided

22
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:37,549
at the last minute that they really wanted a girl.

23
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,049
So my parents, who were on a waiting list,

24
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:44,469
got a call in the middle of the night asking: "We have an unexpected

25
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:46,919
baby boy; do you want him?"

26
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:53,074
They said: "Of course." My biological mother later found out that

27
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:55,309
my mother had never graduated from college

28
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:58,469
and that my father had never graduated from high school.

29
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:02,449
She refused to sign the final adoption papers.

30
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:05,389
She only relented a few months later when

31
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:12,509
my parents promised that I would go to college. This was the start in my life.

32
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:19,339
And 17 years later I did go to college. But I naively chose a college

33
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:21,659
that was almost as expensive as Stanford,

34
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:24,309
and all of my working-class parents'

35
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:26,779
savings were being spent on my college tuition.

36
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:30,409
After six months, I couldn't see the value in it.

37
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,759
I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life

38
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:36,379
and no idea how college was going to help me figure it out.

39
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:40,089
And here I was spending all of the money my parents had saved

40
00:02:40,289 --> 00:02:40,899
their entire life.

41
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:46,938
So I decided to drop out and trust that it would all work out OK.

42
00:02:46,939 --> 00:02:49,398
It was pretty scary at the time,

43
00:02:49,399 --> 00:02:52,808
but looking back it was one of the best decisions I ever made.

44
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,689
The minute I dropped out I could stop

45
00:02:56,690 --> 00:02:59,484
taking the required classes that didn't interest me,

46
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:03,599
and begin dropping in on the ones that looked interesting.

47
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:08,099
It wasn't all romantic. I didn't have a dorm room,

48
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:10,498
so I slept on the floor in friends' rooms,

49
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:14,179
I returned coke bottles for the 5 cent deposits to buy food with,

50
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:17,279
and I would walk the 7 miles across town every Sunday

51
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,079
night to get one good meal a week at the Hare Krishna

52
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:23,079
temple. I loved it.

53
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:26,259
And much of what I stumbled into by following

54
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:29,689
my curiosity and intuition turned out to be priceless later on.

55
00:03:29,689 --> 00:03:34,374
Let me give you one example: Reed College at that

56
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:37,989
time offered perhaps the best calligraphy instruction in the country.

57
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:42,748
Throughout the campus every poster, every label on every drawer,

58
00:03:42,749 --> 00:03:45,108
was beautifully hand calligraphed.

59
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:48,888
Because I had dropped out and didn't have to take the normal classes,

60
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:52,679
I decided to take a calligraphy class to learn how to do this.

61
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:56,094
I learned about serif and san serif typefaces,

62
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:57,949
about varying the amount of space

63
00:03:57,950 --> 00:03:59,664
between different letter combinations,

64
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:02,399
about what makes great typography great.

65
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:05,579
It was beautiful, historical,

66
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:09,179
artistically subtle in a way that science can't capture,

67
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,448
and I found it fascinating.

68
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:16,798
None of this had even a hope of any practical application in my life.

69
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:18,774
But ten years later,

70
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:21,629
when we were designing the first Macintosh computer,

71
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:25,469
it all came back to me. And we designed it all into the Mac.

72
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:28,939
It was the first computer with beautiful typography.

73
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:32,769
If I had never dropped in on that single course in college,

74
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,589
the Mac would have never had multiple

75
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:37,114
typefaces or proportionally spaced fonts.

76
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,614
And since Windows just copied the Mac,

77
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:43,515
it's likely that no personal computer would have them.

78
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:51,139
If I had never dropped out,

79
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:54,039
I would have never dropped in on this calligraphy class,

80
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:57,149
and personal computers might not have the wonderful typography

81
00:04:57,150 --> 00:05:00,519
that they do. Of course it was impossible to connect

82
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,448
the dots looking forward when I was in college.

83
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:06,649
But it was very, very clear looking backwards ten years later.

84
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:10,149
Again, you can't connect the dots looking forward;

85
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:12,498
you can only connect them looking backwards.

86
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:15,549
So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect

87
00:05:15,549 --> 00:05:16,443
in your future.

88
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:20,729
You have to trust in something, your gut, destiny, life, karma,

89
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:21,439
whatever.

90
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:28,098
Beleiveing that the dots will connect down the road will give you the confidence to follow your heart

91
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:33,345
Even when it leads you off the well worn path, and that will make all the difference.
