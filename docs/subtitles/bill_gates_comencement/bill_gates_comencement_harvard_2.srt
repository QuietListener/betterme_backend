1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,110
我在哈佛最难忘的回忆之一发生在1975年1月
one of my biggest memories of Harvard came in January 1975 when I made a call

2
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:11,060
那时我从宿舍给位于Albuquerque的一家公司打了一个电话，
from career house to a company in  Albuquerque new mexico that have begun

3
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:14,300
那家公司已经在着手制造世界上第一台个人电脑，
making the world's first personal  computer

4
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:20,360
我提出想向他们出售软件，我很担心他们会发觉我是一个住在宿舍的学生，
I offered to sell them software I worried they would realize I was just a

5
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:23,120
从而挂断电话，
student in a dorm and hang up on.

6
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:26,180
但是他们却说:“我们还没准备好，
instead they said we're not quite ready

7
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:31,400
一个月后你再来找我们吧。” 这是个好消息，
come see us in a month which was a good  thing,

8
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:32,829
因为那时我软件还根本没写出来呢。
because we hadn't written the software yet.

9
00:00:32,829 --> 00:00:40,119
就是从那时起，我日以继夜地在这个小小的课外项目上工作，
from that moment I work day and night on the extra credit project that marked the

10
00:00:40,119 --> 00:00:45,429
这导致了我学生生活的结束，以及通往微软公司的不平凡的旅程开始，
end of my college education and the  beginning of a remarkable journey with

11
00:00:45,429 --> 00:00:52,419
不管怎样，我对哈佛的回忆主要都与充沛的精力和智力活动有关，
Microsoft what I remember above all about Harvard was being in the midst of

12
00:00:52,419 --> 00:00:54,970
哈佛的生活令人愉快，也令人感到压力。
so much energy and intelligence

13
00:00:54,970 --> 00:01:01,149
有时甚至会感到泄气，
it could be exhilarating intimidating  sometimes even discouraging

14
00:01:01,149 --> 00:01:02,229
但永远充满了挑战性。
but always challenging

15
00:01:02,229 --> 00:01:06,339
生活在哈佛是一种吸引人的特殊待遇，虽然我离开得比较早，
it was an amazing privilege and though I left early

16
00:01:06,849 --> 00:01:13,179
但是我在这里的经历，在这里结识的朋友，在这里发展起来的一些想法，永远地改变了我。
I was transformed by my years at Harvard the friendships I made and the ideas I worked on.

17
00:01:13,179 --> 00:01:17,649
但是，如果现在严肃地回忆起来，
but taking a serious look back,

18
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:26,769
我确实有一个真正的遗憾，我离开哈佛的时候，根本没有意识到
I do have one big regret I left Harvard with no real awareness of the awful

19
00:01:26,769 --> 00:01:28,389
这个世界是多么的不平等，
inequities in the world

20
00:01:28,389 --> 00:01:34,479
人类在健康、财富和机遇上的不平等大得可怕，
the appalling disparities of health and well an opportunity that condemn

21
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:35,979
它使得无数的人们被迫生活在绝望之中。
millions of people the lives of despair

22
00:01:35,979 --> 00:01:41,889
我在哈佛学到了很多经济学
I learned a lot here at Harvard about new ideas and

23
00:01:41,889 --> 00:01:43,539
和政治学的新思想
economics and politics

24
00:01:43,539 --> 00:01:49,359
我也了解了很多科学上的新进展，
I got great exposure to the advances being made in the sciences

25
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:54,849
但是，人类最大的进步并不来自于这些发现，
but humanity's greatest advances are not in its discoveries but in how those

26
00:01:54,849 --> 00:01:58,509
而是来自于那些有助于减少人类不平等的发现。
discoveries are applied to reduce inequity

27
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:06,410
鼓掌......
yeah

28
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:15,810
不管通过何种手段，民主制度、健全的公共教育体系，高质量的医疗保健，
whether through democracy strong public education quality health care are broad

29
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:21,060
还是广泛的经济机会， 减少不平等始终是人类最大的成就。
economic opportunity producing an equity is the highest human achievement

30
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:28,139
我离开校园的时候，根本不知道在这个国家里，有几百万的年轻人
I left campus knowing little about the  millions of young people cheated out of

31
00:02:28,139 --> 00:02:33,540
无法获得接受教育的机会，我也不知道，
educational opportunities here in this  country and I knew nothing about the

32
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:39,930
发展中国家里有无数的人们生活在无法形容的贫穷和疾病之中。
millions of people living in unspeakable poverty and disease in developing countries

34
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:48,510
我花了几十年才明白了这些事情，在座的各位同学，你们是在与我不同的时代来到哈佛的
it took me decades to find out you graduates came to Harvard at a different time

36
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:53,130
你们比以前的学生更多地了解
you know more about the worlds in equities than the classes that came

37
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:56,430
世界是怎样的不平等，
before in your years here

38
00:02:56,430 --> 00:03:02,670
在你们的哈佛求学过程中，我希望你们已经思考过一个问题，
I hope you had a chance to think about how in this age of accelerating

39
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:08,580
那就是在这个新技术加速发展的时代，我们怎样最终应对这种不平等，
technology we can finally take on these inequities and we can solve them

40
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:15,210
以及我们怎样来解决这个问题，为了讨论的方便，请想象假如你每个星期
imagine just for the sake of discussion that you had a few hours a week and a

41
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:20,820
可以捐献一些时间，每个月可以捐献一些钱，你希望这些时间和金钱可以用到对
few dollars a month to donate to a cause and you wanted to spend that time

42
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:27,000
拯救生命和改善人类生活有最大作用的地方，
and money or would have the greatest impact in saving and improving lives

43
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,470
你会选择什么地方？这也是我和Melinda（盖茨夫人）面临的问题。
where would you spend it？ for Melinda and I the  challenges the same

44
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:37,410
我们如何能将我们拥有的资源发挥出最大的作用，
how can we do the most good for the  greatest number with the resources we have

46
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:43,560
在讨论过程中，Melinda和我读到了一篇文章，里面说在那些贫穷的国家，
during our discussions on this question Linda and I read an article about the

47
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:48,630
每年有数百万的儿童死于
millions of children were dying every year in poor countries from diseases

48
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:52,710
在美国早已不成问题的疾病。
that we had long ago made harmless in  this country

49
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:55,949
麻疹、疟疾、肺炎、
measles malaria pneumonia

50
00:03:56,490 --> 00:04:04,020
乙型肝炎、黄热病，还有一种以前我从未听说过的轮状病毒
hepatitis B yellow fever one disease that I had never heard of rotavirus was

51
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:06,810
每年导致50万儿童的死亡。
killing half a million children each year

52
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:12,150
但是在美国一例死亡病例也没有。我们被震惊了，
none of them in the United States we  were shot we'd assumed

53
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:18,330
我们想如果几百万儿童正在死亡线上挣扎，而且他们是可以被挽救的，
that millions of children were dying and they could be saved the world would make

54
00:04:18,330 --> 00:04:23,970
那么世界理应将用药物拯救他们作为头等大事。
it a priority to discover and deliver  the medicines to save them.

55
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:26,760
但是事实并未如此，那些价格还不到一美元的救命药剂
but it did not for under a dollar

56
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:31,050
并没有送到他们的手中。
there were interventions that could save lives - just weren't being delivered

57
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:36,030
如果你相信每个生命都是平等的
if you believe that every life has equal value

58
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:42,600
那么我们无法接受某些生命被拯救了，而另一些生命 却被放弃了。
it's revolting to learn that some lives  are seen as worth saving and others are not

60
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:48,120
我们对自己说，事情不可能如此，但如果这是真的，
we said to ourselves this can't be true， but if it is true

61
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:54,660
那么它理应是我们努力的头等大事，所以我们开始行动，
it deserves to be the priority of our  giving. so we began up and begin our work

62
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:58,980
用任何人都想得到的方式开始工作。
in the same way anyone here would begin  it.

63
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:03,680
我们问：“这个世界怎么可以眼睁睁看着这些孩子死去？”
we asked how could the world let these  children die?

64
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:09,600
答案很简单，也很令人难堪。在市场经济中，拯救儿童是一项
by the answer is simple and harsh，the market did not reward

65
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:14,490
没有利润的工作，政府也不会提供补助。
saving the lives of these children, and  governments did not subsidize it.

66
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:19,950
这些儿童之所以会死亡，是因为他们的父母在经济上没有实力，
So the children died because their  mothers and fathers had no power in the

67
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:28,740
在政治上没有能力发出声音。但你们和我两者都具备，
market and no voice in the system. but  you and I have both.

68
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:31,590
我们可以让市场更好地为穷人服务，
we can make market for forces work better for the poor

69
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:34,980
如果我们能发展出一种更有创新性的资本主义制度，
if we can develop a more creative  capitalism

70
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:42,150
如果我们可以改变市场让更多的人可以获得利润，
if we can stretch the reach of market  forces so that

71
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:44,700
或至少能自食其力，这就可以帮到那些
more people can make a profit or at least earn a living

72
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:49,170
正在极端不平等的状况中受苦的人们。
serving people who are suffering from the great in equities

73
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:55,800
我们还可以向全世界的政府施压，要求他们将纳税人的钱
we can also press governments around the  world to spend taxpayer money in ways

74
00:05:55,800 --> 00:06:03,240
花到更符合纳税人价值的地方，
that better reflect the values of the  people who pay the taxes if we can find

75
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:08,550
如果我们能够找到这样一种方法，既可以帮到穷人，又可以为商人带来利润，
approaches that meet the needs of the poor in ways that generate profits for

76
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:11,490
为政治家带来选票，
business and votes for politicians

77
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:16,200
我们就找到了一种减少世界性不平等的可持续的发展道路。
we will have found a sustainable way to reduce inequity in the world.

78
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:19,110
这个任务
now this task

79
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:25,080
是无限的，它不可能被完全完成，但任何自觉地解决这个问题的尝试，
is open-ended it can never be finished . But a conscious effort to answer this

80
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:27,960
都将会改变这个世界。
challenge can change the world.

81
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:35,250
在这个问题上，我是乐观的，但我也遇到过那些感到绝望的怀疑论者，
I'm optimistic that we can do this but I talked to skeptics claim there is no hope.
