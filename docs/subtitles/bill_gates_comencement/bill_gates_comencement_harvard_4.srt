它为学习和交流提供了巨大的机会，

00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:17,870
网络的神奇之处，不仅仅是它缩短了物理距离，
about this network is not just that it  collapses distance，

4
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:19,740
使得天涯若比邻，
and makes everyone your neighbor.

5
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:25,350
它还极大地增加了具有共同想法的人们聚集在一起的机会，
it also dramatically increases the  number of brilliant minds we can bring

6
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:31,320
我们可以为了解决同一个问题一起共同工作，这就大大加快了革新的进程
into work together on the same problem.  and it skills up the rate of potential

7
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:38,310
发展速度简直快得让人震惊。与此同时，世界上有条件上网的人
innovation to a staggering degree. at the  same time for every person who has

8
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:42,030
只是全部人口的六分之一，这意味着，

9
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:46,590
还有许多具有创造性的人们没有加入到我们的讨论中来。
that means many creative minds are left  out of this discussion.

10
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:52,800
那些有着实际操作经验和相关经历的聪明人，却没有技术来帮助他们，
smart people with practical intelligence  and relevant experience who don't have

11
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:58,500
将他们的天赋或者想法与全世界分享。
the technology to hone their talents or  contribute their ideas to the world.

12
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:06,900
我们需要尽可能地让更多的人有机会使用新技术，
we need as many people as possible to  gain access to this technology because

13
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:12,690
因为这些新技术正在引发一场革命，
these advances are triggering a  revolution in human and what human

14
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:15,210
人类将因此可以互相帮助。
beings can do for one another.

15
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:20,730
新技术正在创造一种可能，不仅是政府，
they are making it possible not just for  national governments but for

16
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:26,880
还包括大学、公司、小机构甚至个人。
universities corporations small  or ganizations and even individuals to

17
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:32,730
能够发现问题所在，能够找到解决办法，能够评估他们努力的效果，
see problems see approaches and measure  the impact of their efforts to address

18
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:35,730
去改变那些马歇尔60年前 the hunger poverty and desperation

19
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:39,510
就提出过的问题---饥饿、贫穷和绝望。
George Marshall spoke up 60 years ago

20
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:48,090
哈佛是一个大家庭，这个院子在场的人们
members of the Harvard family here in  the yard is one of the great collections

21
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:51,090
是全世界最有智力的人类群体之一，
of intellectual talent in the world,

22
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:58,020
我们可以做些什么？毫无疑问，
for what purpose there is no question  that the faculty

23
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:03,580
哈佛的老师、校友、学生和资助者已经用他们的能力
the Alumni the students and the  benefactors of Harvard have used their

24
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:10,450

power to improve the lives of people  here and around the world but can we do

25
00:02:10,450 --> 00:02:17,320
有没有可能，哈佛的人们可以将他们的智慧用来帮助那些甚至从来
more than Harvard dedicate its intellect  to improving the lives of people will

26
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:20,320
没有听到过“哈佛”这个名字的人。
never even hear its name

27
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:25,750
请允许我向各位院长和教授提出一个请求，你们是哈佛的
let me make a request of the deans and  the professor's the intellectual leaders

28
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:33,760
智力领袖，当你们雇佣新的老师，授予终身教职，评估课程
here at Harvard as you hire new faculty  award tenure review curriculum and

29
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:40,299
决定学位颁发标准的时候，请问你们自己如下的问题：
determine degree requirements please ask  yourself：should our best minds be more

30
00:02:40,299 --> 00:02:45,789
我们最优先的人才是否在致力于解决我们最大的问题？
dedicated to solving our biggest problems should Harvard encourage its

31
00:02:45,789 --> 00:02:53,909
哈佛是否鼓励她的老师去研究解决世界上最严重的不平等？
faculty to take on the world's worst in equity

32
00:02:58,330 --> 00:03:03,909
哈佛的学生是否知道世界上那些极端的贫穷？
in harvard students know about the depth  of global poverty?

33
00:03:03,909 --> 00:03:07,779
世界性的饥荒，清洁水资源的缺乏，

the girls get out of school the children  who die from diseases we can cure,

35
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:20,049
世界上过着最优越生活的人们，有没有了解到这个世界最贫穷的
should the world's most privileged learn  about the lives of the world's

36
00:03:20,049 --> 00:03:21,130
人们的生活？
least privilege?

37
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:24,130
这些问题并非老生常谈。
these are not reported question

38
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:34,380
你必须用自己的行动来回答它们。
you will answer with your policies.

39
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:39,090
我母亲在我被哈佛大学录取的那一天，
My mother who is filled with pride

40
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:45,720
曾经感到非常骄傲，她从没有停止督促我去为他人做更多的事情。
the day i was admitted，her never stop  pressing me to do more for others.

41
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:50,760
在我结婚的前几天，她主持了一个新娘进我家的仪式，在这个仪式上，
A few days before I was married she hosted a bridal event and when she read aloud a

42
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:56,070
她高声朗读了一封关于婚姻的信，这是她写给Melinda的，那时，
letter about marriage that she had  written to Melinda my mother was very

43
00:03:56,070 --> 00:04:01,680
我母亲已经因为癌症病入膏肓，但是她还是认为这是又一个
ill with cancer at the time but she saw  one more opportunity to deliver her

44
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:07,230
传播她的信念的机会，在那封信的结尾，她写道：你的能力越大，
message and at the close of the letter  she said from those to whom much is

45
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:14,230
人们对你的期望也就越高。
given much is expected.

46
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:26,560
想一想吧，我们在这个院子里的这些人，被给予过什么，
when you consider what those of us here  in this yard have been given in talent

47
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:32,620
天赋，特权，机遇，可以这样说，这个世界完全有权
privilege and opportunity there is  almost no limit to what the world has a

48
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:37,870
期待我们做出贡献，同这个时代的期望一样，
right to expect from us, in line with the  promise of this age,

49
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:43,530
我也要向今天各位毕业的同学提出一个忠告，
I want to exhort each of the graduates  here to take on  290 00:26:23,530 --> 00:26:25,370 你们要选择一个复杂的问题，一个有关于人类  an issue a complex problem，

50
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:48,430
深刻的不平等的问题，然后你们要变成这个问题的专家，
a deep in equity and become a specialist on it.

51
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:51,850
如果你们能够使得这个问题成为你们职业的核心，那么你们就会非常杰出。
if you make it the focus of your career  that would be phenomenal.

52
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:58,960
但是你们不必一定要以此为职业，每个星期只用几个小时，
but you don't have to do that to make an  impact for a few hours every week

53
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:04,570
你就可以通过不断成长的互联网得到信息，
you can use the growing power of the  internet to get informed find others

54
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:06,370
找到志同道合的朋友，

55
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:09,940
并发现困难所在，找到解决它们的途径，
see the barriers and find ways to cut  through them.

56
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:13,840
不要让世界的复杂性阻碍你前进，
don't let complexity stop you,

57
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:17,980
在解决人类的不平等事业中做一个积极的行动主义者。

58
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:25,810
它将成为你生命中最重要的经历之一，在座的各位毕业的同学
I feel sure it will be one of the great  experiences of your lives you graduates

59
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:32,230
你们所处的时代是一个神奇的时代，当你们离开哈佛的时候，你们拥有的
are coming of age in an amazing time as  you leave Harvard you have technology

60
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:38,530
技术是我们那一届学生所没有的，你们已经了解到了我们以前所不了解的
that members of my class never hand. You  have awareness of global equity which we

61
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:44,380
世界上的不平等。有了这样的了解之后，若再弃那些需要帮助的人们于不顾，
did not have, and with that awareness you  likely also have an informed conscience

62
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:46,270
必将受到良心的谴责。
that will torment you.

63
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:52,750
只需一点小小的努力，你就可以改变那些人们的生活。
if you abandon these people whose lives， you could change with modest effort you

64
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:54,520
你们拥有比我们更大的能力，
have more than we had,

65
00:05:54,520 --> 00:06:00,080
你们必须尽早开始，尽可能长期坚持下去，我希望30年后，
you must start sooner and carry on  longer and I hope

66
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:06,230
你们还会再回到哈佛，回溯你们用自己的天赋和能力
you will come back here to Harvard 30  years from now and reflect on what

67
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:09,679
所做出的一切。我希望那时，
you've done with your talent and your energy

68
00:06:09,679 --> 00:06:15,950
你们用来评价自己的标准，不仅仅是你们的专业成就，
I hope you will judge your selves not on  your professional accomplishments alone

69
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:23,330
还包括你们为改变这个世界深刻的不平等所做出的努力，
but also on how well you have addressed  the world's deepest inequities on how

70
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:26,330
以及你们如何善待那些远隔世界那边的人们，
well you treated people a world away

71
00:06:26,929 --> 00:06:31,190
与你们毫不相关的人们，但他们也是人类！
we have nothing in common with you, but  their humanity!

72
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:40,190
祝各位好运！
good luck

73
00:06:41,910 --> 00:07:24,000
长时间鼓掌......
Long applause......
