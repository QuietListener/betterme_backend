00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:39,320
这位仁兄本来可以在这里完成学业，
just think what you could have achieved,

9
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:46,700
如果他在这里再读两年的话。
if you had stayed here another two years.

10
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:53,230
没错 yeah

11
00:00:56,930 --> 00:01:03,950
他在1973年秋天入读哈佛就已经对计算机科学入迷，

00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:06,950
但却没有一个明确的学习计划，

在玩拉德克利夫扑克游戏中悟到了他未来的商机，

众多杰出同学中的一位
a close friend in college

19
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:48,250
通过记录我看到当年他在著名的普特南数学课中打瞌睡，
i'm using the recall seeing him doze off  during the prestigious Putnam math exam

20
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:52,870
不过尽管如此他仍得了高分。
despite this napping he scored  remarkably well,

21
00:01:53,410 --> 00:02:00,400
在大三时，他停学离开哈佛

members of the Harvard corporation  and the Board of Overseers members of

31
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:25,270
各位老师，各位家长，同学们：
the faculty parents and especially the  graduates：

32
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:30,670
有一句话我等了30年，现在终于可以说了，
I've been waiting more than 30 years to  say this

33
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:36,970
老爸，我总是跟你说我会回来拿到我的学位的，
dad，I always told you I'd come back and  get my degree.

34
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:53,080
我要感谢哈佛大学在这个时候给我这个荣誉，
I want to thank Harvard for this honor

35
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:58,480
明年，我就要换工作了，我终于可以在简历上写
I'll be changing my job next year and it  will be nice to finally have a college

36
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,370
我有一个本科学位了，真不错啊！
degree on my resume.

37
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:08,380
我为今天在座的各位同学感到高兴，你们拿到学位可比我简单多了。
I applaud the graduates for taking a much more direct route to your degrees

38
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:13,480
哈佛的校报称我是
from our my part I'm just happy that the  Crimson called me

39
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:16,480
“哈佛历史上最成功的辍学生”
Harvard's most successful drop out.

40
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:22,139
我想这大概使我有资格代表我这一类学生发言，
I guess that makes me valedictorian of my own special class

41
00:04:23,009 --> 00:04:26,009
在所有失败者当中，我做的最好，
I did the best of everyone who fail

42
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:35,010
但我还是要提醒大家，我使得Ballmer也从哈佛商学院
but i also want to be recognized as the guy who got Steve Ballmer to drop out of

43
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:38,010
退学了。
business school

44
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:43,740
因此我是一个有恶劣影响力的人，
I'm a bad influence,

45
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:50,000
这就是为什么我被邀请来在你们的毕业典礼上演讲。
that's why i was invited to speak at your graduation

46
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:57,020
如果我在你们的入学欢迎仪式上演讲，那么能够坚持到今天在这里的也许会少很多，
if I'd spoken at your orientation you  were of you might be here today

47
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:05,770
对我来说，在哈佛的求学是一段非凡的经历，
Harvard was a phenomenal experience for  me

48
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:12,850
校园生活很有趣，我常去旁听我没选修的课，
academic life was fascinating I used to sit in on lots of classes that I haven't

49
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:16,630
课外生活也很棒，
even signed up for and dorm life was  tripping

50
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:19,690
我在Radcliffe过着逍遥自在的日子，
I lived up at Radcliffe and career house

51
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:26,210
每天我的宿舍总有很多人一直待到半夜，讨论各种事情，
there are always a lot of people in my dorm room late at night discussing

52
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:30,890
因为每个人都知道我从不考虑
things because everyone knew that I didn't worry about

53
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:32,660
第二天早起，
getting up in the morning.

54
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:38,180
这使我成了校园里那些不安分学生的头头，我们过从甚密，
that's how I came to be the leader of  the anti social group we clung to each

55
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:42,350
做出一种拒绝所有正常学生的姿态。
other as a way of validating our rejection of all those social people

56
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:49,220
Radcliffe是个过日子的好地方，那里的女生比男生多，
Radcliffe was a great place to live  there were more women up there and most

57
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:51,590
而且大多数男生都是理工科的，
of the guys were mouth science types.

58
00:05:51,590 --> 00:06:00,380
这种状况为我创造了最好的机会，如果你们明白我的意思。
the combination offered me the best odds  if you know what I mean.

59
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:09,089
可惜的是，我正是在这里学到了人生中悲伤的一课，机会大，并不等于你就会成功。
that's where I learned the sad lesson that improving  your odds doesn't guarantee success
