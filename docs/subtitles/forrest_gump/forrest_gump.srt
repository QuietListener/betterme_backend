你好 我叫福雷斯 福雷斯甘
Hello. My name's Forrest - Forrest Gump.

00:03:30,009 --> 00:03:31,943
要吃巧克力吗?
Do you want a chocolate?

3
00:03:34,514 --> 00:03:38,952
我能吃掉上百万块巧克力
I could eat about a million and a half of these.

4
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:40,954
我妈妈常说
My mama always said

5
00:03:41,023 --> 00:03:44,754
人生就像一盒各式各样的巧克力
Life was like a box of chocolates.

6
00:03:46,362 --> 00:03:48,956
你永远不知道下一块将会是哪种

00:03:56,374 --> 00:03:59,309
那双鞋子一定很舒适

穿这样的鞋子你可以走上一整天

00:04:02,816 --> 00:04:04,750
脚都不会痛

我希望能有一双这样的鞋子

其实我的脚很痛

妈妈常说要想知道一个人的很多事情
Mama always said there's an awful lot

13
00:04:14,998 --> 00:04:18,934
只要看看他穿的鞋就能知道
you can tell about a person by their shoes.

14
00:04:19,003 --> 00:04:20,937
他会往哪里走
Where they're going,

15
00:04:21,005 --> 00:04:22,472
他住在哪里
where they've been.

16
00:04:29,515 --> 00:04:32,075
我穿过很多双鞋子
I've worn lots of shoes.

17
00:04:34,021 --> 00:04:36,956
如果我仔细想的话
I bet if I think about it real hard

18
00:04:37,025 --> 00:04:39,459
我能记得我第一双鞋子的模样
I could remember my first pair of shoes.

19
00:04:42,198 --> 00:04:45,260
妈妈说它会带我到任何地方
Mama said they'd take me anywhere .

20
00:04:45,394 --> 00:04:48,420
她说它是双魔鞋
She said they was my magic shoes.

21
00:04:48,498 --> 00:04:51,934
好的 福雷斯 张开双眼
All right, Forrest, Open your eyes now .

22
00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:00,307
你走几步看看
Let's take a little walk around.

23
00:05:07,955 --> 00:05:09,547
感觉如何？
How do those feel?

24
00:05:12,962 --> 00:05:15,260
他的双腿很强壮 甘太太
His legs are strong, Mrs. Gump,

25
00:05:15,331 --> 00:05:17,765
是我见过最强壮的
as strong as I've ever seen.

26
00:05:17,834 --> 00:05:21,895
但是他的背象政客一样弯
But his back's as crooked as a politician.

27
00:05:21,973 --> 00:05:25,340
但我们会让他再直起来 对吧？
But we're going to straighten him right up, aren't we, Forrest?

28
00:05:25,411 --> 00:05:26,673
福雷斯！
Forrest!

29
00:05:26,745 --> 00:05:29,407
我刚出世时
Now, when I was a baby,

30
00:05:29,482 --> 00:05:32,246
妈用了一位内战英雄的名字为我取名
Mama named me after the great Civil War hero

31
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:33,320
内森贝弗福雷斯将军
General Nathan Bedford Forrest.

32
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,412
内森贝弗福雷斯将军
General Nathan Bedford Forrest.

33
00:05:34,488 --> 00:05:37,924
她说我们有点亲戚关系
She said we was related to him in some way.

34
00:05:37,993 --> 00:05:39,426
他做过的事情是：
What he did was,

35
00:05:39,494 --> 00:05:42,930
建立了一个俱乐部叫三Ｋ党
he tarted up this club called the Ku Klux Klan.

36
00:05:42,999 --> 00:05:46,435
他们全披着长袍和床单
They'd all dress up in their robes and their bed sheets

37
00:05:46,503 --> 00:05:50,941
看来像一群鬼
and act like a bunch of ghosts or spooks or something.

38
00:05:51,009 --> 00:05:54,945
他们还在马上也披了床单四处跑
They'd even put bed sheets on their horses and ride around.

39
00:05:55,014 --> 00:05:59,075
不管怎样 这就是我名字的由来：福雷斯甘
And, anyway, that'show I got my name... Forrest Gump.

40
00:05:59,152 --> 00:06:02,485
妈妈说这名字是提醒我
Mama said the Forrest part was to remind me

41
00:06:02,556 --> 00:06:05,491
我们会经常做一些
that sometimes we all do things that, well,

42
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,994
并没有意义的事情
that just don't make no sense.

43
00:06:16,958 --> 00:06:19,893
向这边！
This way. Hold on. Ugh!

44
00:06:19,962 --> 00:06:22,123
好了
All right.

45
00:06:22,198 --> 00:06:24,132
你们在看什么？
What are y'all staring at?

46
00:06:24,201 --> 00:06:25,634
从来没有见过
Haven't you ever seen

47
00:06:25,702 --> 00:06:28,694
小孩子戴脚撑的吗？
a little boy with braces on his legs before ?

48
00:06:29,941 --> 00:06:31,374
不要管其它人
Don't ever let anybody

49
00:06:31,442 --> 00:06:33,876
说他们比你强 福雷斯
tell you they're better than you, Forrest.

50
00:06:33,946 --> 00:06:36,380
如果上帝要让人人都一样的话
If God intended everybody to be the same,

51
00:06:36,449 --> 00:06:39,384
他会给每人一双脚撑
he'd have given us all braces on our legs.

52
00:06:39,452 --> 00:06:43,388
妈妈总有办法让我明白她的意思
Mama always had a way of explaining things so I could understand them.

53
00:06:43,591 --> 00:06:47,926
我们住在17号公路附近
We lived about a quarter mile off Route 17,

54
00:06:47,996 --> 00:06:50,931
距离亚拉巴马州绿茵镇约半哩
about a half mile from the town of Greenbow, Alabama.

55
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,935
这个地方属于绿茵县
That's in the county of Greenbow.

56
00:06:54,004 --> 00:06:56,438
我们的房子来自妈妈的家族
Our house had been in Mama's family

57
00:06:56,507 --> 00:06:58,566
从她爷爷的爷爷的爷爷传下来的

58
00:06:58,643 --> 00:07:02,079
他大概在一千年前飘洋过海来这里
had come across the ocean about a thousand years ago.

59
00:07:02,148 --> 00:07:04,514
房子只有我和妈妈住
Since it was just me and Mama

60
00:07:04,583 --> 00:07:06,517
我们有好多空房间
and we had all these empty rooms,

61
00:07:06,586 --> 00:07:09,020
妈妈将这些空房出租
Mama decided to let those rooms out,

62
00:07:09,089 --> 00:07:10,522
给路过的人住
mostly to people passing through,

63
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:14,186
比如从莫比镇、或蒙哥马利镇来的人
Like from, oh, Mobile, Montgomery, places like that.

64
00:07:14,263 --> 00:07:17,198
我和妈妈靠这个挣到钱
That's how me and Mama got money.

65
00:07:17,266 --> 00:07:20,030
妈妈是个很聪明的女士
Mama was a real smart lady.

66
00:07:20,103 --> 00:07:22,037
记住我说的话,福雷斯
Remember what I told you, Forrest.

67
00:07:22,105 --> 00:07:25,131
你和其它任何人是一样的
You're no different than anybody else is.

68
00:07:27,445 --> 00:07:29,879
听清楚了没有 福雷斯？

69
00:07:29,948 --> 00:07:32,382
你和其它人是一样的
You're the same as everybody else.

70
00:07:32,451 --> 00:07:34,385
你并没有什么不一样
You are no different.

71
00:07:34,453 --> 00:07:39,118
你的孩子有点不一样 甘太太
Your boy's...different, Mrs. Gump.

00:07:39,194 --> 00:07:41,628
他的智商只有75
His I.Q is 75.

73
00:07:41,696 --> 00:07:44,221
我们都是不一样的
Well, we're all different,

74
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:45,562
汉考克先生
Mr. Hancock.

75
00:07:48,805 --> 00:07:51,239
她希望我得到最好的教育
She wanted me to have the finest education

76
00:07:51,308 --> 00:07:54,744
所以她带我去绿茵县中心学校
so she took me to the Greenbow County Central School.

77
00:07:54,812 --> 00:07:57,747
我见到了校长什么的
I met the principal and all.

78
00:07:57,816 --> 00:08:01,081
请你看看这个 甘太太
I want to show you something, Mrs. Gump.

79
00:08:01,154 --> 00:08:03,554
这是正常水平
Now, this is normal.

80
00:08:03,623 --> 00:08:08,618
福雷斯则是在这儿
Forrest is right here .

81

州政府要求智商起码要80
The state require s a minimum I.Q of 80

82
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,329
才能上公立学校

00:08:13,402 --> 00:08:14,699
甘太太
Mrs. Gump,

84
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:17,671
他应该上特殊学校
he's going to have to go to a special school.

85
00:08:17,741 --> 00:08:20,175
在那里他会很好的
Now, he'll be just fine.

86
00:08:20,244 --> 00:08:22,678
正常水平是什么意思?
What does normal mean anyway ?

87
00:08:22,747 --> 00:08:24,681
他可能…
He might be...

88
00:08:24,749 --> 00:08:26,876
反应不太灵敏
a bit on the slow side,

89
00:08:26,952 --> 00:08:28,385
但我儿子福雷斯
but my boy Forrest

90
00:08:28,454 --> 00:08:31,389
应该和其它人一样得到机会
is going to get the same opportunities as everyone else.

91
00:08:31,458 --> 00:08:33,551
他不该去特殊学校
He's not going to some special school

92
00:08:33,628 --> 00:08:35,562
学怎么翻修轮胎
to learn how to retread tires.

93
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:38,622
这不过是区区5分的问题
We're talking about five little points here .

94
00:08:40,469 --> 00:08:43,370
一定会有办法解决的
There must be something can be done.

95
00:08:43,439 --> 00:08:47,900
我们的学校是要排名次的
We're a progressive school system.

96
00:08:47,978 --> 00:08:50,742
我们不想有人拉后腿
We don't want to see anybody left behind.

97
00:08:50,815 --> 00:08:55,583
甘先生在哪儿 甘太太？
Is there a Mr. Gump, Mrs. Gump?

98
00:08:58,392 --> 00:09:00,335
他去度假了
He's on vacation.

99
00:09:17,389 --> 00:09:21,325
你妈妈真是很关心你的教育 孩子

100
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:29,528
你不太会说话 是吗？

度假就是你去一个地方…
Vacation's when you go somewhere...

00:10:02,391 --> 00:10:04,655
然后就不再回来
and you don't ever come back.

109
00:10:08,732 --> 00:10:10,666
总之 我想你可以说
Anyway, I guess you could say

110
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:13,295
我和妈妈无依无靠
me and Mama was on our own.

111
00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:15,338

有时有这么多人和我们一起住
Sometimes, we had so many people staying with us

118
00:10:28,089 --> 00:10:31,525
每个房间都住满了旅客

119
00:10:31,594 --> 00:10:34,028
这些人带着行李箱子

120
00:10:34,096 --> 00:10:37,532
还有帽子箱子 还有样品箱子

121
00:10:37,601 --> 00:10:41,298
福雷斯甘 吃晚饭了！福雷斯？

我在弹吉它给他听

00:11:36,273 --> 00:11:38,366
“哭喊不停”

我和妈妈出去购物

“你只不过是一条猎犬”

149
00:12:01,805 --> 00:12:03,864
“哭喊不停”
# Cryin' all the time #

150
00:12:03,941 --> 00:12:05,374
几年以后 
Some years later,

结果他得了心脏病什么的
Had him self a heart attack or something.

154
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:17,412
看来“王”确实是不好当啊
It must be hard being a king.

155
00:12:20,929 --> 00:12:23,363
你知道 你的记忆有时清楚得不得了
You know, it's funny how you remember some things,

156
00:12:23,432 --> 00:12:24,364
有时却什么也不记得
but some things you can't.

157
00:12:24,567 --> 00:12:27,900
你要开始努力学习了 福雷斯
You do your very best now, Forrest.

158
00:12:27,971 --> 00:12:30,371
我一定会的 妈妈
I sure will, Mama.

159
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:33,967
我记得第一次乘校车去上学
I remember the bus ride on the first day of school

160
00:12:34,045 --> 00:12:35,376
非常清楚
very well.

161
00:12:38,450 --> 00:12:40,315
你上不上车？
Are you coming along?

162
00:12:40,387 --> 00:12:43,879
妈妈说不要上陌生人的车子
Mama said not to be taking rides from strangers .

163
00:12:43,957 --> 00:12:46,482
这是校车
This is the bus to school.

164
00:12:48,964 --> 00:12:51,762
我是福雷斯…福雷斯甘
I'm Forrest... Forrest Gump.

165
00:12:51,833 --> 00:12:53,630
我是多萝西哈里斯
I'm Dorothy Harris.

166
00:12:53,703 --> 00:12:56,137
嗯 现在我们不是陌生人了
Well, now we ain't strangers anymore .

167
00:13:08,888 --> 00:13:11,584
这位子有人了
This seat's taken.

168
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,457
有人了
It's taken.

169
00:13:22,939 --> 00:13:24,463
你不准坐这儿
You can't sit here .

170
00:13:27,278 --> 00:13:30,714
你知道 孩子记事实在奇怪
You know, it's funny what a young man recollects,

171
00:13:30,782 --> 00:13:33,114
我不记得我的出生
'cause I don 't remember being born.

172
00:13:33,185 --> 00:13:36,586
我不记得我的第一份圣诞礼物
I don't recall what I got for my first Christmas,

173
00:13:36,656 --> 00:13:38,089
我也不记得
and I don't know

174
00:13:38,157 --> 00:13:40,591
我第一次去野餐
when I went on my first outdoor picnic,

175
00:13:40,661 --> 00:13:42,094
但我却记得
but I do remember

176
00:13:42,162 --> 00:13:46,155
我第一次听到最甜的声音
the first time I heard the sweetest voice

177
00:13:46,234 --> 00:13:48,134
在整个世界上
in the wide world.

178
00:13:48,204 --> 00:13:51,139
你愿意的话可以坐这儿
You can sit here if you want.

179
00:13:53,477 --> 00:13:57,345
我一生再没见过如此美丽的人
I had never seen anything so beautiful in my life.

180
00:13:57,415 --> 00:14:00,009
她就像一位天使
She was like an angel.

181
00:14:00,085 --> 00:14:03,851
你想坐还是不想坐？
Well, are you going to sit down or aren't you?

182
00:14:07,927 --> 00:14:09,986
你的腿怎么啦？
What's wrong with your legs?

183
00:14:10,064 --> 00:14:11,998
没什么 谢谢你
Um, nothing at all, thank you.

184
00:14:12,066 --> 00:14:14,864
我的的腿好得很
My legs are just fine and dandy.

185
00:14:14,936 --> 00:14:17,871
我和她在并排坐在校车里
I just sat next to her on that bus

186
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:20,875
去学校途中我们一直在说话
and had a conversation all the way to school.

187
00:14:20,944 --> 00:14:23,378
当时我的背像个问号那么弯
My back's crooked like a question mark.

188
00:14:23,447 --> 00:14:26,075
除了妈妈 没有人和我说话
Next to Mama, no one ever talked to me

189
00:14:26,151 --> 00:14:28,551
或问我问题
or asked me questions.

190
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:30,884
你是不是有点傻？
Are you stupid or something?

191
00:14:30,956 --> 00:14:34,016
妈妈说 “做傻事的才是傻瓜”
Mama says, "Stupid is as stupid does."

192
00:14:34,094 --> 00:14:37,086
我叫珍妮
I'm Jenny .

193
00:14:37,164 --> 00:14:39,724
我叫福雷斯…福雷斯甘
I'm Forrest... Forrest Gump.

194
00:14:39,801 --> 00:14:42,235
由那天开始 我们经常在一起
From that day on, we was always together.

195
00:14:42,304 --> 00:14:44,864
珍妮和我形影不离
Jenny and me was like peas and carrots.

196
00:14:47,977 --> 00:14:49,877
她教我怎么爬树
She taught me how to climb.

197
00:14:49,947 --> 00:14:52,438
快 福雷斯 你能做到
Come on, Forrest, you can do it.

198
00:14:52,516 --> 00:14:55,178
我教她怎么摇摆
I showed her how to dangle.

199
00:14:55,253 --> 00:14:56,777
“一个好小…”
"A good little..."

200
00:14:56,855 --> 00:14:59,289
她帮我学怎么认字
She helped me learn how to read,

201
00:14:59,358 --> 00:15:02,452
我教她怎么倒挂
and I showed her how to swing.

202
00:15:03,597 --> 00:15:06,031
有时 我们就那么坐着
Sometimes, we'd just sitout

203
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:08,398
等星星出来
and wait for the stars.

204
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:10,938
妈妈会担心我的
Mama's going to worry about me.

205
00:15:11,006 --> 00:15:13,907
再呆一会儿
Just stay a little longer.

206
00:15:13,976 --> 00:15:18,072
不知为什么 珍妮从来不爱回家
For some reason, Jenny didn 't never want to go home.

207
00:15:18,148 --> 00:15:20,912
好吧 珍妮 我再呆一会儿
O.K.,Jenny, I'll stay .

208
00:15:20,985 --> 00:15:25,286
她是我最好的朋友
She was my most special friend.

209
00:15:27,494 --> 00:15:29,257
我唯一的朋友
My only friend.

210
00:15:31,999 --> 00:15:33,933
妈妈总是对我说
Now, my mama always told me

211
00:15:34,001 --> 00:15:35,935
每天都会有奇蹟
that miracles happen every day

212
00:15:36,004 --> 00:15:37,938
有些人并不同意
Some people don't think so,

213
00:15:38,006 --> 00:15:39,496
但这是真的
but they do.

214
00:15:41,777 --> 00:15:43,870
嗨 傻瓜！
Hey, dummy!

215
00:15:44,982 --> 00:15:47,416
你是哑巴 还是真的是傻瓜？
Are you dumb, or just plain stupid?

216
00:15:47,484 --> 00:15:49,247
喂 我是福雷斯甘
Look, I'm Forrest Gimp.

217
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,651
快跑 福雷斯
Just run away, Forrest.

218
00:15:51,723 --> 00:15:53,088
跑 福雷斯！
Run, Forrest!

219
00:15:53,159 --> 00:15:55,252
快跑！快！
Run away! Hurry!

220
00:15:55,327 --> 00:15:56,885
骑上自行车！
Get the bikes!

221
00:15:56,963 --> 00:15:58,760
我们去捉他！快点！
Let's get him! Come on!

222
00:15:58,832 --> 00:16:00,629
小心点 阿甘！
Look out, Gump!

223
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:03,567
我们来捉你了！
We're going to get you!

224
00:16:03,638 --> 00:16:05,765
跑 福雷斯 跑！
Run, Forrest, run!

225
00:16:05,841 --> 00:16:07,866
跑 福雷斯！
Run, Forrest!

226
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:10,803
你给我回来！
Come back here, you!

227
00:16:25,064 --> 00:16:27,396
跑 福雷斯！
Run, Forrest!

228
00:16:27,467 --> 00:16:29,059
跑！
Run!

229
00:16:59,541 --> 00:17:02,271
你现在大概不会相信我的话…
Now, you wouldn't believe if I told you...

230
00:17:03,345 --> 00:17:06,576
但我跑起来像风一样
but I could run like the wind blows.

231
00:17:08,418 --> 00:17:10,909
从那天开始
From that day on,

232
00:17:10,988 --> 00:17:13,422
如果我要去哪里
if I was going somewhere,

233
00:17:13,491 --> 00:17:15,857
我就跑着去
I was running.

234
00:17:48,701 --> 00:17:52,028
那孩子真是个能跑的傻瓜
That boy sure is a running fool.

235
00:17:54,999 --> 00:17:56,933
记不记得我告诉过你
Now, remember how I told you

236
00:17:57,001 --> 00:17:59,936
珍妮总是不爱回家？
that Jenny never seemed to want to go home?

237
00:18:00,005 --> 00:18:03,372
她家的房子和亚拉巴马州一样老
She lived in a house that was as old as Alabama.

238
00:18:03,443 --> 00:18:06,071
她五岁时她妈妈就去天堂了
Her mama had gone to heaven when she was 5,

239
00:18:06,146 --> 00:18:10,584
她的爸爸好像是个农夫
and her daddy was some kind of a farmer.

240
00:18:10,652 --> 00:18:11,880
珍妮？
Jenny?

241
00:18:11,954 --> 00:18:14,889
他是个非常有爱心的人
He was a very loving man.

242
00:18:14,958 --> 00:18:19,122
他经常亲吻抚摸她和她姐妹
He was always kissing and touching her and her sisters.

243
00:18:20,965 --> 00:18:22,899
后来有一次
And then this one time,

244
00:18:22,967 --> 00:18:25,902
珍妮没有来乘车去学校
Jenny wasn't on the bus to go to school.

245
00:18:25,971 --> 00:18:28,405
珍妮 你今天怎么不来学校？
Jenny, why didn't you come to school today?

246
00:18:28,474 --> 00:18:30,908
嘘 爸爸正在午睡
Shh. Daddy's taking a nap.

247
00:18:30,977 --> 00:18:32,069
珍妮！
Jenny!

248
00:18:32,145 --> 00:18:34,409
快点！
Come on!

249
00:18:34,481 --> 00:18:37,416
珍妮 你往哪儿跑？
Jenny, where'd you run to?

250
00:18:37,485 --> 00:18:40,010
你最好马上回来 丫头！
You better get back here, girl!

251
00:18:42,324 --> 00:18:44,155
你在哪儿？
Where you at?

252
00:18:47,497 --> 00:18:48,930
珍妮！
Jenny!

253
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,865
珍妮 你在哪儿？
Jenny, where you at?

254
00:18:53,672 --> 00:18:54,639
珍妮！
Jenny!

255
00:18:54,706 --> 00:18:56,640
和我一起祈祷 福雷斯
Pray with me, Forrest.

256
00:18:56,709 --> 00:18:58,142
和我一起祈祷
Pray with me.

257
00:18:58,211 --> 00:18:59,439
珍妮！
Jenny!

258
00:18:59,512 --> 00:19:02,811
亲爱的上帝 把我变成一只会飞的鸟吧
Dear God, make me a bird so I can fly far,

259
00:19:02,883 --> 00:19:04,817
飞得越远越好
far, far away from here .

260
00:19:04,885 --> 00:19:09,823
亲爱的上帝 把我变成一只会飞的鸟吧
Dear God, make me a bird so I can fly far.

261
00:19:09,892 --> 00:19:12,827
妈妈常说上帝是神秘的
Mama always said God is mysterious.

262
00:19:12,895 --> 00:19:14,226
珍妮！
Jenny!

263
00:19:14,297 --> 00:19:17,232
那天他没有把珍妮变成一只鸟
He didn 't turn Jenny in to a bird that day.

264
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:19,063
而是…
Instead,

265
00:19:19,137 --> 00:19:21,071
他叫来了警察
he had the police say

266
00:19:21,139 --> 00:19:24,575
说珍妮再也不必住在那间房子里了
Jenny didn't have to stay in that house no more.

267
00:19:24,643 --> 00:19:27,077
后来她和她祖母住在一起
She was to live with her grandma,

268
00:19:27,147 --> 00:19:29,081
就是克里克大街那里
just over on Creekmore Avenue,

269
00:19:29,149 --> 00:19:33,142
我很高兴 因为她那里离我家很近
which made me happy, 'cause she was so close.

270
00:19:34,489 --> 00:19:35,615
有时晚上
Some nights,

271
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:37,624
珍妮会溜出来
Jenny'd sneak out

272
00:19:37,692 --> 00:19:40,126
跑到我的房子里
and come on over to my house,

273
00:19:40,196 --> 00:19:42,630
因为她说她很害怕
just'cause she said she was scared.

274
00:19:42,699 --> 00:19:45,691
害怕什么 我不知道
Scared of what, I don 't know.

275
00:19:45,769 --> 00:19:48,431
我猜是怕她祖母的狗
But I think it was her grandma's dog.

276
00:19:48,506 --> 00:19:51,441
他是只很凶的狗
He was a mean dog.

277
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:54,673
总之 珍妮和我是最好的朋友
Anyway, Jenny and me was best friends

278
00:19:54,747 --> 00:19:56,237
一直到上中学
all the way up through high school.

279
00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:58,683
嗨 傻瓜！
Hey, stupid!

280
00:19:58,752 --> 00:20:00,720
住手！
Quit it!

281
00:20:00,788 --> 00:20:02,221
跑 福雷斯 跑！
Run, Forrest, run!

282
00:20:03,759 --> 00:20:05,784
你没听见吗 傻瓜？
didn't you hear me, stupid?

283
00:20:05,861 --> 00:20:06,793
跑 福雷斯！
Run, Forrest!

284
00:20:06,862 --> 00:20:08,193
快上卡车！
Get in the truck!

285
00:20:08,264 --> 00:20:11,597
快！他要跑了！快追！
Come on! He's getting away! Move it!

286
00:20:11,668 --> 00:20:14,136
跑 福雷斯！跑！
Run, Forrest! Run!

287
00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:21,105
快追 快追！
Move it! Move it!

288
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:23,011
你快跑吧！
You better be runnin'!

289
00:20:36,565 --> 00:20:39,227
哇！ - 快！
- Whoo-hoo! - Go!

290
00:20:41,839 --> 00:20:44,330
跑 福雷斯！
Run, Forrest!

291
00:20:46,478 --> 00:20:48,002
一直以来
Now, it used to be

292
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:51,015
我到哪儿都跑着去
I ran to get where I was going.

293
00:20:51,084 --> 00:20:54,417
我没想过后来会跑遍所有地方
I never thought it would take me anywhere .

294
00:21:23,057 --> 00:21:25,116
那究竟是什么人？
Who in the hell is that?

295
00:21:25,193 --> 00:21:27,991
那人叫福雷斯甘 教练
That there is Forrest Gump, Coach.

296
00:21:28,063 --> 00:21:30,054
当地的傻瓜
Just a local idiot.

297
00:21:30,132 --> 00:21:32,498
你能相信吗？
And can you believe it?

298
00:21:32,569 --> 00:21:35,367
我也能上大学了
I got to go to college, too.

299
00:21:41,079 --> 00:21:42,512
福雷斯 快！
Forrest, move it!

300
00:21:42,581 --> 00:21:43,513
跑！
Run!

301
00:21:43,582 --> 00:21:44,514
好！
O.K. !

302
00:21:44,584 --> 00:21:45,676
跑！
Run!

303
00:21:45,751 --> 00:21:48,584
跑 你这狗娘养的傻瓜！跑！
Run, you stupid son of a bitch! Run!

304
00:22:01,438 --> 00:22:04,339
跑 狗娘养的 跑！快跑！
Run, son of a bitch, run! Go! Run!

305
00:22:06,544 --> 00:22:09,240
跑！跑！
Run! Run! Go!

306
00:22:20,628 --> 00:22:24,064
他大概是狗娘养的最傻的傻瓜
He must be the stupidest son of a bitch alive ,

307
00:22:24,132 --> 00:22:26,100
但他跑得真是快
but he sure is fast.

308
00:22:29,071 --> 00:22:30,936
也许只是我这样觉得
Now, maybe it's just me,

309
00:22:31,008 --> 00:22:34,068

313
00:22:41,754 --> 00:22:43,688

今天是作为亚拉巴马州的联邦士兵

去面对我们谈论已久的危机

今天的事清楚地显示…

338
00:23:44,765 --> 00:23:48,565
我们的国家正在走向军事独裁
A trend toward military dictatorship in this country.

339
00:23:51,607 --> 00:23:53,541
就这样 当天傍晚

华莱士州长说到做到

在图卡卢沙的校园里 他让人们…

教学楼门口那位坏脾气的小个子

觉得去竞选总统是个好主意

男女都有
It was coed.

365
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:12,000
珍妮上的大学我不能去上

但我一有机会就去看她
But I'd go and visit her every chance I got.

368
00:25:23,170 --> 00:25:26,469

00:46:16,701 --> 00:46:18,965
就是总有地方可去
is there was always someplace to go.

777
00:46:19,037 --> 00:46:20,299
小心手雷！
Fire in the hole!

778
00:46:23,875 --> 00:46:26,469
阿甘 搜一下那个洞
Gump, check out that hole.

779
00:46:26,544 --> 00:46:29,479
也总有事情可做
And there was always something to do.

780
00:46:29,547 --> 00:46:30,639
准备好！

散开！掩护他！
Spread out! Cover his back!

782
00:46:37,589 --> 00:46:40,183
有一天开始下雨了
One day it started raining,

00:46:40,258 --> 00:46:43,591
然后一直不停的下了四个月
and it didn't quit for four months.

784

我们经历了各种各样的雨…
We've been through every kind of rain there is...

785
00:46:47,165 --> 00:46:49,793
象小针样的雨

786
00:46:50,315 --> 00:46:53,524
还有倾盆大雨
and big old fat rain,

787
00:46:53,585 --> 00:46:56,027
从侧面下的雨
rain that flew in side ways,

788
00:46:56,145 --> 00:46:57,806
有时甚至还有
and sometimes rain even seemed

789
00:46:57,883 --> 00:47:01,215
从下往上的雨
to come straight up from underneath.

00:47:01,287 --> 00:47:04,813
连晚上也下雨
Shoot, it even rained at night.

791
00:47:04,892 --> 00:47:06,652
嘿 福雷斯
Hey, Forrest.

792
00:47:06,727 --> 00:47:07,815
嘿 布巴
Hey, Bubba.

793
00:47:07,897 --> 00:47:10,159
我的背靠着你的背
I'm going to lean up against you.

794
00:47:10,233 --> 00:47:11,663
你的背靠着你的背
You lean up against me.

795
00:47:11,735 --> 00:47:13,997
这样我们睡着的时候
This way we don't have to sleep

796
00:47:14,073 --> 00:47:16,003
头就不会钻进泥里
with our heads in the mud.

797
00:47:16,075 --> 00:47:18,667
你知道为何我们是好伙伴 福雷斯？
You know why we're a good partnership, Forrest?

798
00:47:18,747 --> 00:47:22,010
因为我们互相照顾

799
00:47:22,085 --> 00:47:23,845
就像兄弟一样
like brothers and stuff.

800
00:47:25,757 --> 00:47:27,347
嘿 福雷斯
Hey, Forrest,

801
00:47:27,427 --> 00:47:29,517
我在考虑一件事
something I been thinking about.

802
00:47:29,596 --> 00:47:32,528
我有个很重要的问题要问你
I got a very important question to ask you.

803
00:47:34,269 --> 00:47:36,199
你想不想
How would you like to go

804
00:47:36,272 --> 00:47:38,202
和我一起去捕虾？
into the shrimping business with me?

805
00:47:39,778 --> 00:47:41,038
好的
O.K.

806
00:47:41,113 --> 00:47:42,873
兄弟 你听我说
Man, I tell you what.

807
00:47:42,950 --> 00:47:45,212
我全计划好了
I got it all figured out, too.

808
00:47:45,287 --> 00:47:46,717
我们捕到的虾多少磅
So many pounds of shrimp

809
00:47:46,789 --> 00:47:48,219
拿来付买船的贷款
will pay off the boat.

810
00:47:48,291 --> 00:47:49,721
多少磅拿来付油费
So many pounds for gas.

811
00:47:49,792 --> 00:47:51,722
我们住在船上就行
We'll live right on the boat.

812
00:47:51,796 --> 00:47:54,058
这样就不用付房租
We ain't got to pay no rent.

813
00:47:54,133 --> 00:47:56,063
我们合伙来干
We can just work it together,

814
00:47:56,136 --> 00:47:58,066
全部都对半分
split everything right down the middle.

815
00:47:58,139 --> 00:48:00,229
兄弟 告诉你 五五分成
Man, I'm telling you, 50-50.

816
00:48:00,309 --> 00:48:03,333
还有 福雷斯 虾可以随便吃
Hey, Forrest, all the shrimp you can eat.

817
00:48:04,914 --> 00:48:07,506
真是个好主意
That's a fine idea.

818
00:48:07,586 --> 00:48:10,347
布巴的主意真得很好
Bubba did have a fine idea.

819
00:48:14,900 --> 00:48:15,600
我甚至写信给珍妮
I even wrote Jenny

820
00:48:16,235 --> 00:48:18,165
告诉她这件事情
and told her all about it.

821
00:48:18,238 --> 00:48:19,828
我给她寄信…
I sent her letters...

822
00:48:19,908 --> 00:48:21,998
差不多每天都寄
Not every day, but almost.

823
00:48:22,077 --> 00:48:24,339
告诉她我在做的事
I told her what I was doing

824
00:48:24,414 --> 00:48:26,847
也问她在做些什么
and asked her what she was doing

825
00:48:26,918 --> 00:48:30,110
告诉她我经常想念她
and told her how I thought about her always.

826
00:48:31,482 --> 00:48:33,412
和我多么希望
And how I was looking forward

827
00:48:33,485 --> 00:48:35,415
能收到她一封回信
to getting a letter from her

828
00:48:35,488 --> 00:48:38,249
只要她有时间
just as soon as she had the time.

829
00:48:38,327 --> 00:48:41,259
我总是告诉她我很平安
I'd always let her know that I was O. K.

830
00:48:41,330 --> 00:48:48,760
然后我的落款总是“爱你的福雷斯甘”
Then I'd sign each letter "Love, Forrest Gump. "

831
00:48:58,688 --> 00:49:01,449
“有事情正在发生”
# There's somethin' happenin' here #

832
00:49:02,795 --> 00:49:06,389
那一天 我们象平常一样走着
This one day, we was out walking like always,

833
00:49:06,466 --> 00:49:10,230
然后 忽然之间
and then, just like that,

834
00:49:10,306 --> 00:49:12,236
就像有人关掉天上的水龙头
somebody turned off the rain,

835
00:49:12,309 --> 00:49:13,899
太阳出来了
and the sun come out.

836
00:49:13,978 --> 00:49:16,739
“我必须小心”
# I got to beware #

837
00:49:16,816 --> 00:49:18,906
有埋伏！
Ambush!

838
00:49:18,985 --> 00:49:20,915
快找掩护！

快把它拿过来 见鬼

从两个方向！有冲锋枪和火箭筒！

847
00:49:53,764 --> 00:49:55,024
我们损失惨重！

God damn it!

850
00:50:01,108 --> 00:50:05,041
把那玩意扔掉撤退到树林！
Get that pig unfucked and on the treeline!

851
00:50:06,882 --> 00:50:09,474
他们压住我们了
They got us, and it hurt.

852
00:50:09,554 --> 00:50:13,045
我们准备撤退
We're going to move back to the blue line.

853
00:50:13,126 --> 00:50:16,024
撤退！撤退！
Pull back! Pull back!

854
00:50:16,097 --> 00:50:18,084

00:50:55,355 --> 00:50:59,380
我一直跑 就像珍妮要我做的
I ran and ran just like Jenny told me to.

861
00:51:02,132 --> 00:51:04,325
我跑得这么快这么远
I ran so far so fast

862
00:51:04,401 --> 00:51:06,834
很快就只剩下我一个人
that pretty soon I was all by myself,

863
00:51:06,905 --> 00:51:08,495
这下糟糕了
which was a bad thing.

864
00:51:08,575 --> 00:51:09,663
布巴
Bubba.

865
00:51:12,246 --> 00:51:14,336
布巴是我最好的朋友
Bubba was my best good friend.

866
00:51:14,417 --> 00:51:16,850
我要保证他没事
I had to make sure he was O.K.

867
00:51:25,935 --> 00:51:28,368
你在哪儿？
Where the hell are you?

868
00:51:28,437 --> 00:51:30,527
布巴！

869
00:51:30,608 --> 00:51:33,540
我回去找布巴途中
And on my way back to find Bubba,

870
00:51:33,613 --> 00:51:36,374
发现有个人躺在地上
well, there was this boy laying on the ground.

871
00:51:36,451 --> 00:51:37,435
泰克斯
Tex.

872

我不能让他单独躺在那里
I couldn't let him lay there all alone,

874
00:51:43,561 --> 00:51:44,991
他非常害怕
scared the way he was,

875
00:51:45,063 --> 00:51:46,823
所以我扶起他
so I grabbed him up

876
00:51:46,899 --> 00:51:48,625
背他逃出那里
and run him out of there.

877
00:52:03,856 --> 00:52:06,584
每次我回去找布巴
Every time I went back looking for Bubba,

878
00:52:06,661 --> 00:52:08,091
总有人在喊：
somebody else was saying,

879
00:52:08,162 --> 00:52:11,094
“救命 福雷斯 救命！”
"Help me, Forrest, help me! "

880
00:52:17,678 --> 00:52:19,837
好了 好了
O.K. Here. Here .

881
00:52:22,152 --> 00:52:25,118
不要怕 兄弟 躺下 你会没事的
No sweat, man. Lay back. You'll be O.K.

882
00:52:27,526 --> 00:52:31,986
我开始担心我可能永远找不到布巴
I started to get scared that I might never find Bubba.

883

这一带到处都是“越共”

What are you doing?

啊！我说把我留在这儿 该死的！

突然好像有什么东西跳起来咬我

啊！什么东西在咬我！
Aah! Something bit me!

900
00:53:19,203 --> 00:53:21,133
你这狗娘养的！
You son of a bitch!

901
00:53:22,609 --> 00:53:25,633
我不能离开我的排
I can't leave the platoon.

902
00:53:25,712 --> 00:53:27,644
我叫你把我留在那里 阿甘
I told you to leave me there, Gump.

903

I didn't ask you to pull me out of there, God damn you!

908
00:53:43,274 --> 00:53:45,000

932
00:55:58,643 --> 00:56:01,575
你中弹了
You got shot.

933
00:56:01,645 --> 00:56:06,014
布巴说了一句我永远不会忘记的话
Then Bubba said something I won't ever forget.

934
00:56:06,086 --> 00:56:09,646
我想回家
I want to go home.

935
00:56:09,726 --> 00:56:12,521
布巴是我最好的好朋友
Bubba was my best good friend.

936
00:56:12,596 --> 00:56:14,526
我还知道
And even I know

937
00:56:14,599 --> 00:56:18,034
好朋友不是那么容易找到的
that ain't something you can find just around the corner.

938
00:56:18,105 --> 00:56:21,540
布巴想当一个捕虾船的船长
Bubba was going to be a shrimping boat captain,

939
00:56:21,611 --> 00:56:25,910
但是 他却死在越南的一条河边
but instead, he died right there by that river in Vietnam.

940
00:56:31,492 --> 00:56:33,822
我要说的就是这些了
That's all I have to say about that.

941
00:56:36,033 --> 00:56:38,226
那是粒子弹 是吗？
It was a bullet, wasn't it?

942
00:56:40,139 --> 00:56:41,569
子弹？
A bullet?

943
00:56:41,640 --> 00:56:44,368
跳起来咬你的那个东西
That jumped up and bit you.

944
00:56:45,513 --> 00:56:47,375
啊 对 先生
Oh. Yes, sir.

正好咬在我屁股上
Bit me directly in the but-tocks .

946
00:56:50,152 --> 00:56:54,589
他们说这样的伤口价值百万 但…
They said it was a million dollar wound, but...

947
00:56:54,659 --> 00:56:56,589
那些钱大概是被军队留着了
the army must keep that money ,

948
00:56:56,662 --> 00:57:00,595
因为那一百万我至今连半毛钱也没看见
'cause I still ain't seen a nickel of that million dollars .

949
00:57:00,668 --> 00:57:04,424
屁股受伤的唯一好处
The only good thing about being wounded in the but-tocks

950
00:57:04,562 --> 00:57:06,322
是冰淇淋

00:57:06,397 --> 00:57:09,295
我能吃多少冰淇淋他们就给我多少
They gave me all the ice cream I could eat.

952
00:57:09,369 --> 00:57:10,799
你猜怎么着？
And guess what?

00:57:10,870 --> 00:57:14,770
我的一位好朋友就在隔壁床上
A good friend of mine was in the bed right next door.

954
00:57:16,080 --> 00:57:19,138
丹中尉 我给你拿冰淇淋来了

00:58:34,444 --> 00:58:35,874
把它关掉
Turn it off.

你正在收看美军台
You are tuned to the American forces

接得好 阿甘
Good catch, Gump.

You know how to play this?

00:58:50,969 --> 00:58:53,436
来 我教你
Come on. Let me show you.

977
00:58:54,974 --> 00:58:57,407
打乒乓球的关键就是
Now, the secret to this game is

978
00:58:57,477 --> 00:58:59,407
无论发生什么事
no matter what happens,

979
00:58:59,480 --> 00:59:01,913
永远不要…
never, ever...

980
00:59:01,985 --> 00:59:04,075
把目光离开球
take your eye off the ball.

981
00:59:06,993 --> 00:59:08,253
好吧
All right.

982
00:59:11,500 --> 00:59:12,930
不知为什么
For some reason,

983
00:59:13,002 --> 00:59:15,435
我天生是打乒乓的料
Ping-Pong came very natural to me.

于是我开始经常打球
So I started playing it all the time.

我打乒乓球
I played Ping-Pong

00:59:24,218 --> 00:59:27,812
甚至没人陪着也能打

医院里的人

但连丹中尉也来看我打球
Even Lieutenant Dan would come and watch me play.

993

没什么事是完全偶然的 它总有缘故
Nothing just happens. It's all part of a plan!

999
01:00:11,615 --> 01:00:14,604
我应该和我的士兵一起死在那儿

1000

但现在…我只是个他妈的残废人

你知不知道
Do you know what it's like

没有腿是什么感觉？
not to be able to use your legs?

1006
01:00:31,143 --> 01:00:33,198
是 长官 我知道
Y-Y -Yes, sir, I do.

1007

而你…使我得不到它！
and you... cheated me out of it!

1014
01:01:00,119 --> 01:01:02,483
你听明白我的话了吗 阿甘？
You understand what I'm saying, Gump?

1015
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:08,051
本来不应该是这样…
This wasn't supposed to happen...

1016
01:01:08,131 --> 01:01:09,926
我不应该这样
Not to me.

1120
01:08:14,653 --> 01:08:17,780
强奸我们的女人 摧毁我们黑人社区

黑人士兵总被送往前线

对不起我在你们黑豹党聚会上打架

他不是故意这么做的

1149
01:09:57,310 --> 01:09:59,776
我永远也不会伤害你 珍妮

很开心我们俩能一起到首都来

我们整晚到处逛 我和珍妮

聊天

她告诉我她所有的旅行

她如何发现了新的思想
and how she discovered ways to expand her mind

1163
01:10:56,703 --> 01:11:00,255
学习怎样在和谐中生活…
and learn how to live in harmony...

1164
01:11:00,391 --> 01:11:02,288
和谐那地方一定是在我们西边

1165
01:11:02,360 --> 01:11:05,293
因为她一路去到了加州

1166
01:11:05,365 --> 01:11:07,296
“去爱另一个人”

01:11:29,834 --> 01:11:30,762
珍妮？
Jenny?

1176

所有的事都乱套了
Things got a little out of hand.

1177
01:11:35,344 --> 01:11:36,934
都是因为这场战争
It's just this war

1178
01:11:37,012 --> 01:11:39,772
还有爱撒谎的约翰逊总统和…

我永远不会伤害你 你知道的

你应该回绿茵镇的家

福雷斯 我不能接受这个

01:12:32,364 --> 01:12:33,794
我能得到它…
I got it...

1190
01:12:33,867 --> 01:12:37,199
都是因为我做了你叫我做的事
just by doing what you told me to do.

1191
01:12:38,876 --> 01:12:42,140
你为何对我这么好？
Why are you so good to me?

1192

“什么都在改变改变改变”

01:13:27,485 --> 01:13:30,316
就是这样
And just like that,

1199
01:13:30,393 --> 01:13:35,426
他再次离开我的生活
she was gone out of my life again.

1200
01:13:35,703 --> 01:13:37,950
这是个人的一小步
That's one small step for man,

1201
01:13:39,543 --> 01:13:41,983
人类的一大步
one giant leap for mankind.

01:13:47,963 --> 01:13:49,161
我以为我要回越南去
I thought I was going back to Vietnam,

1203
01:13:50,598 --> 01:13:51,907

我对付共产党的最好办法
the best way for me to fight the Communists

1205
01:13:54,127 --> 01:13:56,075
是打乒乓球
was to play Ping-Pong,

1206
01:13:56,084 --> 01:13:58,299
于是我接受了一个特别任务

1207
01:13:58,328 --> 01:13:59,832
走遍全国
traveling around the country,

军队又觉得我应该

加入全美乒乓球队

我们是第一批访问中国大陆的美国人

有人说世界和平就在我们手中
Somebody said world peace was in our hands,

1216
01:14:19,070 --> 01:14:21,923
但我所做的只不过是打乒乓球

1217
01:14:22,004 --> 01:14:25,037
回家以后 我成了全国有名的人物

难以想像

嗯 只要你肯试着想像 迪克
Well, it's easy if you try, Dick.

1233
01:15:14,672 --> 01:15:16,103
几年以后
Some years later,

我不知道我应该去找他 长官
I didn't know I was supposed to be looking for Him, sir.

1275
01:17:38,645 --> 01:17:42,101
从越南回来的残废军人

1281
01:17:59,669 --> 01:18:02,603
但我只能顾到自己
but I have to help myself.

1282
01:18:02,674 --> 01:18:05,608
如果我的心能接受耶稣

我就可以与他在天国同行

01:23:54,668 --> 01:23:56,096
今天与尼克松总统见面…
met with President Nixon today...

1396
01:23:56,167 --> 01:23:57,788
你知道吧？
Wouldn't you know it?

1397
01:23:57,866 --> 01:23:59,589
几个月后
A few months later,

1398
01:23:59,665 --> 01:24:02,595
他们邀请我和乒乓球队
they invited me and the Ping-Pong team

1399
01:24:02,663 --> 01:24:04,091
去白宫
to visit the White House.

1400
01:24:04,163 --> 01:24:05,557
所以我去了…
So I went...

1401
01:24:05,629 --> 01:24:06,784
第二次去
again.

1402
01:24:06,862 --> 01:24:10,653
并且第二次见到了合众国的总统
And I met the president of the United States again.

1403
01:24:10,727 --> 01:24:13,279
不过这次他们没有给我们安排
Only this time, they didn't get us rooms

1404
01:24:13,359 --> 01:24:15,082
酒店套房
in a real fancy hotel.

1405
01:24:15,157 --> 01:24:16,585
你玩得愉快吗
Are you enjoying yourself

1406
01:24:16,656 --> 01:24:18,584
在我们的首都 年轻人？
in our nation's capital, young man?

1407
01:24:18,656 --> 01:24:20,084
你住在哪儿？
where are you staying?

1408
01:24:20,156 --> 01:24:21,584
埃伯特酒店
It's called the Hotel Ebbott.

1409
01:24:21,654 --> 01:24:24,584
啊 不 不。我知道有家更好的酒店
Oh, no, no, no. I know a much nicer hotel.

1410
01:24:24,652 --> 01:24:26,012
是新开张的水门酒店 设备很先进
It's brand-new. Very modern.

1411
01:24:26,087 --> 01:24:28,707
我会叫人安排你入住的
I'll have my people take care of it.

1412
01:24:28,784 --> 01:24:30,007
保安
Security.

1413
01:24:30,084 --> 01:24:31,512
是 先生
Yeah. Sir,

1414
01:24:31,584 --> 01:24:34,514
你能不能叫人维修人员
you might want to send a maintenance man

1415
01:24:34,582 --> 01:24:37,009
去对面办公室看看
over to that office across the way .

1416
01:24:37,079 --> 01:24:38,507
里面灯不亮
The lights are off

1417
01:24:38,580 --> 01:24:41,510
他们大概正在找保险丝盒
and they must be looking for a fuse box ,

1418
01:24:41,578 --> 01:24:44,508
因为他们打着手电 把我都照醒了
'cause them flashlights, they're keeping me awake .

1419
01:24:44,576 --> 01:24:46,504
好的 先生。我去查一下
O.K., sir. I'll check it out.

1420
01:24:46,575 --> 01:24:47,867
谢谢 晚安
Thank you. Good night.

1421
01:24:51,074 --> 01:24:52,502
因此…
Therefore...

1422
01:24:52,573 --> 01:24:54,501
我将辞去总统职位
I shall resign the presidency

1423
01:24:54,571 --> 01:24:56,829
从明天中午起生效
effective at noon tomorrow.

1424
01:24:56,904 --> 01:24:58,832
福特副总统
Vice President Ford

1425
01:24:58,903 --> 01:25:00,990
将宣誓就任总统
will be sworn in as president

1426
01:25:01,069 --> 01:25:03,723
明天此时在这间办公室
at that hour in this office.

1427
01:25:14,829 --> 01:25:16,291
福雷斯甘
Forrest Gump.

1428
01:25:16,362 --> 01:25:17,983
是 长官！
Yes, sir!

1429
01:25:18,060 --> 01:25:19,488
根据条例
As you were.

1430
01:25:19,560 --> 01:25:21,488
我收到你的退役批文
I have your discharge papers.

1431
01:25:21,557 --> 01:25:23,212
服役期结束了 孩子
Service is up, son.

1432
01:25:25,490 --> 01:25:28,781
是不是说我不能再打乒乓球了？
Does this mean I can't play Ping-Pong no more?

1433
01:25:28,854 --> 01:25:30,817
对军队来说 是的
For the army, it does.

1434
01:25:32,986 --> 01:25:34,914
就这样
And just like that,

1435
01:25:34,985 --> 01:25:38,413
我在合众国军队的生活结束了
my service in the United States Army was over.

1436
01:25:42,980 --> 01:25:44,943
所以我回家
So I went home.

1437
01:26:06,603 --> 01:26:08,122
我回家了 妈妈
I'm home, Mama.

1438
01:26:08,203 --> 01:26:10,596
我知道 我知道
I know. I know .

1439
01:26:11,966 --> 01:26:13,394
露西 他来了
Louise, he's here .

1440
01:26:13,466 --> 01:26:16,396
当我回家时 我不知道做什么
Now, when I got home, I had no idea,

1441
01:26:16,465 --> 01:26:18,892
但妈妈有很多访客
but Mama had all sorts of visitors.

1442
01:26:18,964 --> 01:26:20,892
我们有客人来访
We've had all sorts of visitors .

1443
01:26:20,963 --> 01:26:24,391
每个人都想要你用他们的乒乓器材
Everybody wants you to use their Ping-Pong stuff.

1444
01:26:24,460 --> 01:26:27,320
有个人还留了一张两万五的支票
One man even left a check for $25,000

1445
01:26:27,393 --> 01:26:30,821
希望你能说：你爱用他们的球拍
if you'd be agree able to saying you like using their paddle.

1446
01:26:30,892 --> 01:26:33,822
我只爱用我自己的球拍
I only like using my own paddle.

1447
01:26:33,890 --> 01:26:35,284
嗨 露西小姐
Hi, Miss Louise.

1448
01:26:35,356 --> 01:26:36,342
嘿 福雷斯
Hey, Forrest.

1449
01:26:36,422 --> 01:26:39,317
我知道 可那是两万五啊 福雷斯
I know that, but it's $25,000, Forrest.

1450
01:26:39,387 --> 01:26:42,815
我想也许你可以试用一段时间
I thought maybe you could hold it for a while,

1451
01:26:42,885 --> 01:26:45,312
看看顺不顺手
see if it grows on you.

1452
01:26:45,385 --> 01:26:47,313
妈妈的确说得对
That Mama, she sure was right.

1453
01:26:47,384 --> 01:26:50,071
事情总是出乎意料
It's funny how things work out.

1454
01:26:50,208 --> 01:26:52,102
我在家没有待太久
I didn't stay home for long

1455
01:26:52,173 --> 01:26:54,600
因为我答应过布巴
because I'd made apromise to Bubba,

1456
01:26:54,672 --> 01:26:57,099
我总要信守我的诺言
and I always try to keep my promise,

1457
01:26:57,171 --> 01:26:59,598
所以我去了拉巴特湾
so I went on down to Bayou La Batre

1458
01:26:59,670 --> 01:27:01,155
去见布巴的家人
to meet Bubba's family.

1459
01:27:01,234 --> 01:27:05,627
你是疯子还是傻瓜？
Are you crazy or just plain stupid?

1460
01:27:05,701 --> 01:27:08,924
做傻事的才是傻瓜 布鲁太太
Stupid is as stupid does, Mrs. Blue.

1461
01:27:08,998 --> 01:27:09,926
我想也是
I guess.

1462
01:27:09,998 --> 01:27:11,426
当然
And, of course,

1463
01:27:11,497 --> 01:27:14,584
我也去看望了布巴本人
I paid my respect to Bubba himself.

1464
01:27:15,828 --> 01:27:18,482
嘿 布巴 是我 福雷斯甘
Hey, Bubba. It's me, Forrest Gump.

1465
01:27:21,826 --> 01:27:23,754
我记得你说过的话
I remember everything you said,

1466
01:27:23,825 --> 01:27:26,685
我已经安排好了
and I got it all figured out.

1467
01:27:28,356 --> 01:27:34,975
我带来两万四千五百六十二块四毛七分
I'm taking $24,562.47

1468
01:27:35,052 --> 01:27:37,173
这是我所有的钱
that I got, that's left

1469
01:27:37,252 --> 01:27:39,679
其它钱用来理发和买新衣服
after a new hair cut and a new suit

1470
01:27:39,750 --> 01:27:42,680
还有带妈妈上街吃了一顿好饭
and took Mama out to a real fancy dinner,

1471
01:27:42,748 --> 01:27:45,608
还买了车票 还买了三瓶汽水
and I bought a bus ticket, then three Dr. Peppers.

1472
01:27:45,680 --> 01:27:47,666
告诉我
Tell me something.

1473
01:27:47,746 --> 01:27:50,173
你是傻瓜吗？
Are you stupid or something?

1474
01:27:50,245 --> 01:27:52,933
做傻事的才是傻瓜 先生
Stupid is as stupid does, sir.

1475
01:27:53,011 --> 01:27:54,939
我拿到这些钱是因为我说：
That's what's left after me saying,

1476
01:27:55,010 --> 01:27:58,938
“我和全美乒乓球队在中国时 
"When I was in China on the all-America Ping-Pong team,

1477
01:27:59,007 --> 01:28:00,935
“我最喜欢打乒乓球…
"I just loved playing Ping-Pong

1478
01:28:01,007 --> 01:28:03,128
“用我的菲利奥莱乒乓球拍”
with my Flex-O-Lite Ping-Pong paddle,"

1479
01:28:03,204 --> 01:28:05,132
谁都知道这不是真话
which everybody knows isn't true,

1480
01:28:05,203 --> 01:28:08,133
但妈妈说它只是一个善意的谎话
but Mama said it was just a little white lie,

1481
01:28:08,202 --> 01:28:10,130
它不会伤害任何人
so it wasn't hurting nobody.

1482
01:28:10,202 --> 01:28:12,629
总之 剩下的钱我全部用来
So anyway, I'm putting all that

1483
01:28:12,701 --> 01:28:15,128
买燃料、绳索和网具
on gas, ropes, and new nets

1484
01:28:15,200 --> 01:28:18,130
以及一条全新的捕虾船
and a brand-new shrimping boat.

1485
01:28:39,222 --> 01:28:42,650
布巴告诉过我所有和捕虾有关的事情
Now Bubba told me everything he knew about shrimping,

1486
01:28:42,718 --> 01:28:45,648
但你知道我有什么发现吗？
but you know what I found out?

1487
01:28:46,718 --> 01:28:49,270
捕虾很难的
Shrimping is tough.

1488
01:28:51,215 --> 01:28:53,869
我只捕到五只
I only caught five .

1489
01:28:53,946 --> 01:28:57,374
再来两只 你就能做串烧虾了
A couple more, you can have yourself a cocktail.

1490
01:28:59,210 --> 01:29:02,140
嘿 你有没有想过该为这条船命名？
Hey, you ever think about naming this old boat?

1491
01:29:02,209 --> 01:29:05,139
船没有名字就没有好运气
It's bad luck to have a boat without a name.

1492
01:29:05,207 --> 01:29:07,634
我以前从来没有给船命名
I'd never named a boat before,

1493
01:29:07,706 --> 01:29:12,724
我能想起的只有一个名字
but there was only one I could think of,

1494
01:29:12,804 --> 01:29:16,755
世界上最美丽的名字
the most beautiful name in the wide world.

1495
01:29:20,834 --> 01:29:22,319
“跳跳舞”
# Do a little dance #

1496
01:29:22,399 --> 01:29:24,362
“谈谈情”
# Make a little love #

1497
01:29:24,431 --> 01:29:26,359
“度过今晚”
# Get down tonight#

1498
01:29:26,430 --> 01:29:28,721
“度过今晚”
# Get down tonight#

1499
01:29:28,797 --> 01:29:30,985
“跳跳舞”
# Do a little dance #

1500
01:29:31,062 --> 01:29:32,819
“谈谈情”
# Make a little love #

1501
01:29:32,896 --> 01:29:34,517
“度过今晚”
# Get down tonight#

1502
01:29:35,760 --> 01:29:37,052
“度过今晚…”
# Get down tonight... #

1503
01:29:37,125 --> 01:29:39,518
我没听到珍妮的消息
Now, I hadn't heard from Jenny

1504
01:29:39,590 --> 01:29:40,882
已经很久了
in a long while,

1505
01:29:40,957 --> 01:29:43,384
但我仍经常想念她
but I thought about her a lot.

1506
01:29:43,457 --> 01:29:46,544
不管她在做什么 我希望她开心
I hoped whatever she was doing made her happy.

1507
01:29:46,623 --> 01:29:51,641
“你不能改变那只小鸟”
# Oh, and the bird you cannot change #

1508
01:29:55,084 --> 01:30:01,771
“你不能改变这只小鸟”
# And this bird you cannot change #

1509
01:30:01,848 --> 01:30:09,217
“上天知道我无法改变”
# Lord knows I can't change #

1510
01:30:09,289 --> 01:30:16,220
“上天保佑我无法改变”
# Lord, help me, I can't change #

1511
01:31:32,438 --> 01:31:35,874
我时刻想念着珍妮
I thought about Jenny all the time.

1512
01:32:25,424 --> 01:32:30,020
丹中尉 你来做什么？
Lieutenant Dan, what are you doing here?

1513
01:32:30,095 --> 01:32:33,462
嗯 我想到海中施展拳脚
Well, thought I'd try out my sea legs.

1514
01:32:33,533 --> 01:32:36,468
可是你没有脚了 丹中尉
Well, you ain't got no legs, Lieutenant Dan.

1515
01:32:36,536 --> 01:32:37,969
是的 我知道
Yes, I know that.

1516
01:32:38,038 --> 01:32:42,236
你写了封信给我 白痴
You wrote me a letter, you idiot.

1517
01:32:42,309 --> 01:32:44,675
好了 福雷斯甘船长
Well, well. Captain Forrest Gump.

1518
01:32:44,746 --> 01:32:47,613
我要亲眼来看看…
I had to see this for myself...

1519
01:32:48,917 --> 01:32:50,384
并且…
and...

1520
01:32:50,453 --> 01:32:54,890
我说过如果你能当捕虾船的船长
I told you if you were ever a shrimp boat captain,

1521
01:32:54,957 --> 01:32:56,891
我就来当你的大副
that I'd be your first mate.

1522
01:32:56,960 --> 01:32:58,621
所以我来了
Well, here I am.

1523
01:32:58,695 --> 01:33:00,629
我是信守诺言的
I'm a man of my word .

1524
01:33:00,697 --> 01:33:01,721
好的
O.K.

1525
01:33:01,799 --> 01:33:03,960
但你别以为
But don't you be thinking

1526
01:33:04,035 --> 01:33:06,469
我会叫你长官
that I'm going to be calling you "sir."

1527
01:33:06,537 --> 01:33:07,469
不用 长官
No, sir.

1528
01:33:16,016 --> 01:33:17,540
这是我的船
It's my boat.

1529
01:33:20,721 --> 01:33:24,817
我觉得如果我们向东开
I have a feeling if we head due east,

1530
01:33:24,892 --> 01:33:28,453
我们就会找到虾 现在左转
we'll find some shrimp, so take a left.

1531
01:33:29,865 --> 01:33:31,298
向左转！
Take a left!

1532
01:33:31,366 --> 01:33:32,298
哪边？
Which way?

1533
01:33:32,368 --> 01:33:33,300
那边！
Over there!

1534
01:33:33,369 --> 01:33:34,802
他们在那边！
They're over there!

1535
01:33:34,871 --> 01:33:38,204
快打舵盘向左
Get on the wheel and take a left.

1536
01:33:38,275 --> 01:33:39,708
好的
O.K.

1537
01:33:41,045 --> 01:33:42,979
阿甘 你干什么？
Gump, what are you doing?

1538
01:33:43,047 --> 01:33:44,480
向左转！
Take a left!

1539
01:33:44,549 --> 01:33:45,538
左边！
Left!

1540
01:33:47,419 --> 01:33:51,355
那边我们会找到虾的 兄弟！
That's where we're going to find those shrimp, my boy!

1541
01:33:52,425 --> 01:33:54,552
那边我们会找到它们
That's where we'll find them.

1542
01:34:06,974 --> 01:34:08,908
还是没有虾 丹中尉
Still no shrimp, Lieutenant Dan.

1543
01:34:08,977 --> 01:34:10,911
好吧 我弄错了
O.K., so I was wrong.

1544
01:34:10,979 --> 01:34:13,914
嗯 我们怎么才能找到虾呢？
Well, how are we going to find them?

1545
01:34:13,983 --> 01:34:18,010
也许你可以去祷告
Maybe you should just pray for shrimp.

1546
01:34:18,088 --> 01:34:20,750
“所以我们祷告”
# So pray that #

1547
01:34:20,825 --> 01:34:24,090
“我在回家路上…”
# I'm homeward bound... #

1548
01:34:24,161 --> 01:34:26,857
所以我每个星期天都去教堂
So I went to church every Sunday.

1549
01:34:28,300 --> 01:34:30,234
有时丹中尉也来
Sometimes Lieutenant Dan came, too,

1550
01:34:30,302 --> 01:34:34,170
虽然他只让我负责祷告
though I think he left the praying up to me.

1551
01:34:48,690 --> 01:34:50,089
没有虾
No shrimp.

1552
01:34:51,193 --> 01:34:54,128
你那上帝到底在哪儿？
Where the hell's this God of yours?

1553
01:34:54,196 --> 01:34:56,630
奇怪的是丹中尉一说这话
It's funny Lieutenant Dan said that

1554
01:34:56,700 --> 01:35:00,517
上帝就来了
'cause right then God showed up.

1555
01:35:16,169 --> 01:35:18,603
你绝不能弄沉这条船！
You'll never sink this boat!

1556
01:35:18,671 --> 01:35:21,333
我当时很害怕
Now, me, I was scared,

1557
01:35:21,408 --> 01:35:25,469
但丹中尉 他像是发疯了
but Lieutenant Dan, he was mad.

1558
01:35:25,546 --> 01:35:26,535
来吧！
Come on!

1559
01:35:29,083 --> 01:35:31,381
你这算是风暴吗？
You call this a storm?

1560
01:35:31,453 --> 01:35:35,389
来吧 你这狗娘养的！
Come on, you son of a bitch!

1561
01:35:35,458 --> 01:35:39,394
咱们来较量一下吧！
It's time for a show down!

1562
01:35:39,463 --> 01:35:40,930
你和我！
You and me!

1563
01:35:40,997 --> 01:35:44,057
我就在这儿 来捉我吧！
I'm right here! Come and get me!

1564
01:35:46,737 --> 01:35:48,170
你绝不能弄沉…
You'll never sink...

1565
01:35:48,239 --> 01:35:49,536
这条…
this...

1566
01:35:49,607 --> 01:35:50,699
船！
boat!

1567
01:35:52,778 --> 01:35:54,873
卡门飓风昨天过境
Hurricane Carmen came through here yesterday,

1568
01:35:55,006 --> 01:35:56,803
沿途几乎摧毁了一切
destroying nearly everything in its path.

1569
01:35:56,876 --> 01:35:59,811
沿海的其他城镇也一样
And as in other towns up and down the coast,

1570
01:35:59,879 --> 01:36:02,677
拉巴特湾的捕虾业
Bayou La Batre's entire shrimping industry

1571
01:36:02,749 --> 01:36:05,081
成为卡门飓风的最大受害者
has fallen victim to Carmen

1572
01:36:05,152 --> 01:36:07,985
渔港完全成了废墟
and has been left in utter ruin.

1573
01:36:08,054 --> 01:36:09,487
记者被告知
This reporter has learned,

1574
01:36:09,557 --> 01:36:11,991
实际上只有一条捕虾船
in fact, only one shrimping boat

1575
01:36:12,059 --> 01:36:13,583
幸免于难
actually survived the storm.

1576
01:36:13,661 --> 01:36:16,129
露西 露西 福雷斯来了
Louise. Louise, there's Forrest.

1577
01:36:16,198 --> 01:36:19,292
从此以后 捕虾就很容易了
After that, shrimping was easy.

1578
01:36:19,368 --> 01:36:22,132
“将会有丰厚的回报”
# There will be great bounty #

1579
01:36:22,205 --> 01:36:24,867
“我的上帝…”
# Oh, my God... #

1580
01:36:24,941 --> 01:36:26,875
因为人们仍然需要虾
Since people still needed them shrimps

1581
01:36:26,944 --> 01:36:29,310
来做虾串烧和虾烧烤什么的
for shrimp cocktails and barbecues and all

1582
01:36:29,380 --> 01:36:32,315
而我们的船是唯一剩下的了
and we were the only boat left standing,

1583
01:36:32,383 --> 01:36:34,817
他们只能来布巴甘这里买虾
Bubba Gump shrimp's what they got.

1584
01:36:34,886 --> 01:36:37,821
我们购置了一大堆船
We got a whole bunch of boats.

1585
01:36:37,889 --> 01:36:39,823
有12条珍妮号 还有一个大仓库
12 Jennys, big old warehouse.

1586
01:36:39,892 --> 01:36:41,826
我们还订做了帽子
We even have hats

1587
01:36:41,894 --> 01:36:44,328
上面写着“布巴甘”
that say "Bubba Gump" on them.

1588
01:36:44,397 --> 01:36:45,830
布巴甘捕虾公司
Bubba Gump Shrimp.

1589
01:36:45,899 --> 01:36:47,332
这名字家喻户晓
It's a household name.

1590
01:36:47,401 --> 01:36:49,062
等等 小兄弟
Hold on there, boy.

1591
01:36:49,136 --> 01:36:51,570
你是说你就是…
Are you telling me you're the owner

1592
01:36:51,639 --> 01:36:53,869
布巴捕虾公司的老板？
of the Bubba Gump Shrimp Corporation?

1593
01:36:53,942 --> 01:36:56,877
对 我们挣了一大堆钱
Yes. We got more money than Davy Crockett.

1594
01:36:56,946 --> 01:36:59,881
孩子 我听过很多牛皮
Boy, I heard some whoppers in my time,

1595
01:36:59,949 --> 01:37:02,884
这是最大的一个
but that tops them all.

1596
01:37:04,988 --> 01:37:08,389
我们身边正坐着一个百万富翁
We were sitting next to a millionaire .

1597
01:37:11,395 --> 01:37:16,389
嗯 我觉得那是个很有趣的故事
Well, I thought it was a very lovely story,

1598
01:37:16,468 --> 01:37:19,528
你讲得真好
and you tell it so well,

1599
01:37:19,605 --> 01:37:21,698
非常热情洋溢
with such enthusiasm.

1600
01:37:21,774 --> 01:37:25,870
你想看看丹中尉长什么样吗？
Would you like to see what Lieutenant Dan looks like?

1601
01:37:25,945 --> 01:37:28,175
是的 我想看
Yes, I would.

1602
01:37:32,453 --> 01:37:34,080
这个就是他
That's him right there .

1603
01:37:36,324 --> 01:37:39,384
我再讲点关于丹中尉的事
Let me tell you something about Lieutenant Dan.

1604
01:37:39,462 --> 01:37:40,952
福雷斯…
Forrest...

1605
01:37:46,136 --> 01:37:50,266
我一直还没谢谢你救我一命
I never thanked you for saving my life .

1606
01:38:15,470 --> 01:38:17,904
他从来没说出来
He never actually said so,

1607
01:38:17,973 --> 01:38:22,342
但我想他跟上帝已经讲和了
but I think he made his peace with God.

1608
01:38:29,119 --> 01:38:31,917
这是17天里第二次
For the second time in 17 days,

1609
01:38:31,989 --> 01:38:34,423
福特总幸免被刺杀
President Ford escaped possible assassination today.

1610
01:38:34,492 --> 01:38:37,427
总部呼叫珍妮一号。总部呼叫珍妮一号
Base to Jenny 1. Base to Jenny 1.

1611
01:38:37,495 --> 01:38:38,928
珍妮一号 请说
Jenny 1. Go, Margo.

1612
01:38:38,998 --> 01:38:40,932
有福雷斯的电话
Forrest has a phone call.

1613
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:45,437
嗯 你跟他说他迟点再回电话
Yeah, well, you'll have to tell them to call him back.

1614
01:38:45,505 --> 01:38:47,939
他现在很忙
He is indisposed at the moment.

1615
01:38:48,008 --> 01:38:49,475
他妈妈病了
His mama's sick.

1616
01:39:08,565 --> 01:39:09,497
妈妈在哪儿？
Where's Mama?

1617
01:39:09,567 --> 01:39:11,364
她在楼上
She's upstairs .

1618
01:39:13,804 --> 01:39:15,533
嗨 福雷斯
Hi, Forrest.

1619
01:39:16,608 --> 01:39:17,802
明天见
I'll see you tomorrow .

1620
01:39:17,876 --> 01:39:19,173
好的
Oh, all right.

1621
01:39:25,551 --> 01:39:28,384
你的腿全好了 是吗 孩子？
Sure got you straightened out, didn't we, boy?

1622
01:39:40,569 --> 01:39:42,059
怎么了 妈妈？
What's the matter, Mama?

1623
01:39:42,138 --> 01:39:45,301
我快死了 福雷斯
I'm dying, Forrest.

1624
01:39:47,444 --> 01:39:50,345
进来 坐下
Come on in, sit down over here .

1625
01:40:04,064 --> 01:40:06,191
为什么你快死了 妈妈？
Why are you dying, Mama?

1626
01:40:06,266 --> 01:40:08,359
我的时候到了
It's my time.

1627
01:40:08,435 --> 01:40:11,495
因为我的时候到了
It's just my time.

1628
01:40:11,572 --> 01:40:13,597
现在…
Oh, now...

1629
01:40:14,675 --> 01:40:17,235
你不用害怕 宝贝
don't you be afraid, sweet heart .

1630
01:40:17,312 --> 01:40:20,713
死亡只是生命的一部分
Death is just a part of life .

1631
01:40:20,782 --> 01:40:24,741
是我们注定要面对的
Something we're all destined to do.

1632
01:40:24,821 --> 01:40:27,153
我并不知道
I didn't know it,

1633
01:40:27,223 --> 01:40:30,158
但我注定要做你的妈妈
but I was destined to be your mama.

1634
01:40:30,227 --> 01:40:32,957
我就尽力做好
I did the best I could.

1635
01:40:33,030 --> 01:40:34,964
你做得很好
You did good.

1636
01:40:35,033 --> 01:40:41,303
嗯…我相信你能实现自己的命运
Well...I happen to believe you make your own destiny .

1637
01:40:41,373 --> 01:40:45,901
你要凭着上帝所给予的做到最好
You have to do the best with what God gave you.

1638
01:40:49,416 --> 01:40:52,010
我的命运是什么 妈妈？
What's my destiny, Mama?

1639
01:40:52,086 --> 01:40:56,523
你要自己去弄明白
You're going to have to figure that out for yourself.

1640
01:40:57,860 --> 01:41:00,795
人生就像一盒各式各样的巧克力
Life is a box of chocolates, Forrest.

1641
01:41:00,863 --> 01:41:03,798
你永远不知道下一块将会是哪种
You never know what you're going to get.

1642
01:41:03,867 --> 01:41:06,802
妈妈总有办法把事情说清楚
Mama always hada way of explaining things

1643
01:41:06,870 --> 01:41:08,804
让我也能听明白
so I could understand them.

1644
01:41:08,872 --> 01:41:10,339
我会想念你的 福雷斯
I will miss you, Forrest.

1645
01:41:12,076 --> 01:41:14,340
她得了癌症
She had got the cancer

1646
01:41:14,411 --> 01:41:16,345
在星期二去世了
and died on a Tuesday.

1647
01:41:16,414 --> 01:41:19,008
我给她买了顶新帽子
I bought her a new hat

1648
01:41:19,084 --> 01:41:21,109
上面有很多小花
with little flowers on it.

1649
01:41:24,056 --> 01:41:26,752
我要说的说是这么多了
And that's all I have to say about that.

1650
01:41:34,035 --> 01:41:36,731
你不是说你在等7路车吗？
Didn't you say you were waiting for the number 7 bus?

1651
01:41:36,804 --> 01:41:39,534
等一下还会有下一班车的
There'll be another one along shortly.

1652
01:41:43,045 --> 01:41:47,482
现在因为我成了足球明星和战争英雄
Now, because I had been a football star and war hero

1653
01:41:47,551 --> 01:41:50,486
以及全国知名的人物和捕虾船的船长
and national celebrity and a shrimping boat captain

1654
01:41:50,554 --> 01:41:51,987
以及大学毕业生
and a college graduate,

1655
01:41:52,056 --> 01:41:54,490
亚拉巴马州绿茵镇的父老乡亲
the city fathers of Greenbow, Alabama,

1656
01:41:54,559 --> 01:41:57,050
决定给我一个好工作
decided to get together and offered me a fine job.

1657
01:41:58,564 --> 01:42:02,091
所以我不再回去和丹中尉一起工作了
So I never went back to work for Lieutenant Dan,

1658
01:42:02,167 --> 01:42:05,102
但他继续打理着我们布巴甘公司的财产
though he did take care of my Bubba Gump money.

1659
01:42:05,171 --> 01:42:08,106
他替我买了一家卖苹果的公司的股票
He got me invested in some kind of fruit company.

1660
01:42:08,174 --> 01:42:10,608
后有他打电话给我
So then I got a call from him

1661
01:42:10,678 --> 01:42:13,238
说我们再也不用担心没钱花了
saying we don't have to worry about money no more,

1662
01:42:13,314 --> 01:42:17,717
我说：“好啊 又少一件麻烦事”
and I said, "That's good. One less thing."

1663
01:42:17,786 --> 01:42:19,583
“我有了新的希望…”
# I've got a new hope... #

1664
01:42:19,654 --> 01:42:22,088
妈妈说过财产不用太多
Now Mama said there's only so much fortune

1665
01:42:22,158 --> 01:42:23,785
一个人用不了多少
a man really needs,

1666
01:42:23,859 --> 01:42:27,260
多余的钱只是用来炫耀
and the rest is just for showing off.

1667
01:42:27,330 --> 01:42:30,231
所以我拿出一大堆
So I gave a whole bunch of it

1668
01:42:30,300 --> 01:42:33,565
给四方福音教堂…
to the Four square Gospel Church...

1669
01:42:33,637 --> 01:42:38,700
又拿出一大堆给拉巴特湾渔场医院…
and I gave a whole bunch to the Bayou La Batre Fishing Hospital...

1670
01:42:40,179 --> 01:42:42,613
虽然布巴已经死了
and even though Bubba was dead

1671
01:42:42,681 --> 01:42:46,117
丹中尉也说我是笨蛋
and Lieutenant Dan said I was nuts,

1672
01:42:46,186 --> 01:42:48,916
我还是把布巴那一份给了布巴的妈妈
I gave Bubba's mama Bubba's share.

1673
01:42:52,293 --> 01:42:53,954
你猜怎么着？
You know what?

1674
01:42:54,028 --> 01:42:57,964
她再也不用去任何人家的厨房干活了
She didn't have to work in nobody's kitchen no more.

1675
01:42:58,032 --> 01:43:00,626
那感觉真不错
That smells wonderful.

1676
01:43:00,702 --> 01:43:03,136
因为我成了亿万富翁
And 'cause I was a gozillionaire

1677
01:43:03,205 --> 01:43:06,140
并且我喜欢干活
and I liked doing it so much,

1678
01:43:06,209 --> 01:43:09,645
我免费帮他们割草
I cut that grass for free.

1679
01:43:11,081 --> 01:43:14,517
但到了晚上无事可干
But at night time when there was nothing to do

1680
01:43:14,585 --> 01:43:17,019
房子空空荡荡的
and the house was all empty,

1681
01:43:17,088 --> 01:43:20,023
我会经常想念珍妮
I'd always think of Jenny.

1682
01:44:23,539 --> 01:44:27,339
然后…她就出现了
And then...she was there.

1683
01:45:00,114 --> 01:45:01,411
你好 福雷斯
Hello, Forrest.

1684
01:45:01,483 --> 01:45:03,678
你好 珍妮
Hello, Jenny .

1685
01:45:14,531 --> 01:45:17,659
珍妮回来与我一起住
Jenny came back and stayed with me.

1686
01:45:17,735 --> 01:45:22,570
也许因为她没什么别的地方可去了
Maybe it was because she had no where else to go,

1687
01:45:22,640 --> 01:45:26,007
也许因为她太累了
or maybe it was because she was so tired

1688
01:45:26,078 --> 01:45:29,514
因为她总是在睡觉
'cause she went to bed and slept and slept

1689
01:45:29,582 --> 01:45:31,812
好像她多年没睡觉了
like she hadn't slept in years.

1690
01:45:31,885 --> 01:45:34,251
有她在家真好
It was wonderful having her home.

1691
01:45:34,320 --> 01:45:36,754
每天我们都散步
Every day we'd take a walk,

1692
01:45:36,824 --> 01:45:40,760
我不停地跟她说话
and I'd jabber on like a monkey in a tree,

1693
01:45:40,829 --> 01:45:43,764
她听我说乒乓球和捕虾
and she'd listen about Ping-Ponging and shrimping

1694
01:45:43,832 --> 01:45:46,767
还有妈妈去天堂的事
and Mama making a trip up to heaven.

1695
01:45:46,836 --> 01:45:48,770
我不停地说
I did all the talking.

1696
01:45:48,838 --> 01:45:51,329
珍妮总是很安静
Jenny most of the time was real quiet.

1697
01:46:30,987 --> 01:46:33,717
你怎么能这么做？
How could you do this?

1698
01:47:11,033 --> 01:47:15,527
有时我想石头会不够用
Sometimes I guess there just aren't enough rocks.

1699
01:47:17,040 --> 01:47:19,975
我一直不知道她为什么回来
I never really knew why she came back,

1700
01:47:20,044 --> 01:47:21,477
但我不介意
but I didn't care.

1701
01:47:21,545 --> 01:47:23,479
就像昔日重来
It was like olden times.

1702
01:47:23,548 --> 01:47:26,346
我们又形影不离了
We was like peas and carrots again.

1703
01:47:27,986 --> 01:47:30,420
每天我都会采来好看的花
Every day, I'd pick pretty flowers

1704
01:47:30,490 --> 01:47:34,051
放在她的房间里
and put them in her room for her,

1705
01:47:34,127 --> 01:47:37,563
而她给了我人所能得到的最好的礼物
and she gave me the best gift anyone could ever get

1706
01:47:37,631 --> 01:47:39,064
在整个世界里
in the wide world.

1707
01:47:39,133 --> 01:47:41,658
这是最适合跑步的
They're made just for running.

1708
01:47:41,736 --> 01:47:42,998
“带我回家见亲朋”
# Carry me home to see my kin #

1709
01:47:45,674 --> 01:47:48,199
他还教我如何跳舞
And she even showed me how to dance.

1710
01:47:50,046 --> 01:47:52,412
“我又想起老朋友”
#I miss ol'Bammy once again #

1711
01:47:52,481 --> 01:47:53,709
“我不再对他不起”
#And I think it's a sin #

1712
01:47:54,985 --> 01:47:56,646
“亚拉巴马我的家…”
# Sweet home Alabama... #

1713
01:47:56,720 --> 01:48:01,748
我们就像一家人 珍妮和我…
Well, we was like family, Jenny and me...

1714
01:48:04,662 --> 01:48:07,859
那是我一生最快乐的时光
and it was the happiest time in my life.

1715
01:48:32,061 --> 01:48:33,494
你看还要看吗？
You done watching it?

1716
01:48:34,564 --> 01:48:36,555
我要去睡了
I'm going to bed.

1717
01:48:47,447 --> 01:48:49,005
你能嫁给我吗？
Will you marry me?

1718
01:48:54,056 --> 01:48:57,025
我会做个好丈夫的 珍妮
I'd make a good husband, Jenny.

1719
01:48:59,561 --> 01:49:01,461
你会的 福雷斯
You would, Forrest.

1720
01:49:03,900 --> 01:49:05,663
但你不能嫁给我
But you won't marry me.

1721
01:49:08,072 --> 01:49:10,472
你不愿意嫁给我
You don't want to marry me.

1722
01:49:13,578 --> 01:49:15,978
你为什么不爱我 珍妮？
Why don't you love me, Jenny?

1723
01:49:21,420 --> 01:49:23,354
我不是很聪明
I'm not a smart man,

1724
01:49:23,422 --> 01:49:27,882
但我知道什么是爱
but I know what love is.

1725
01:50:04,804 --> 01:50:06,066
珍妮…
Jenny...

1726
01:50:08,142 --> 01:50:10,440
福雷斯 我真的爱你
Forrest, I do love you.

1727
01:51:03,472 --> 01:51:06,066
那你为什么要跑？
Where are you running off to?

1728
01:51:06,143 --> 01:51:07,701
我没有跑
I'm not running.

1729
01:52:38,135 --> 01:52:40,103
那一天
That day,

1730
01:52:40,170 --> 01:52:41,603
不知什么原因
for no particular reason,

1731
01:52:41,672 --> 01:52:44,664
我决定出去跑一趟
I decided to go for a little run.

1732
01:52:44,741 --> 01:52:48,199
所以我跑到路的尽头
So I ran to the end of the road,

1733
01:52:48,279 --> 01:52:51,612
当我到达那里 我想也许我能跑到城边
and when I got there, I thought maybe I'd run to the end of town.

1734
01:52:51,683 --> 01:52:54,311
卡特总统因中暑病倒…
President Carter, suffering from heat exhaustion...

1735
01:52:54,385 --> 01:52:56,376
而当我到达那里
And when I got there,

1736
01:52:56,454 --> 01:53:00,390
我想也许我能跑遍绿茵县
I thought maybe I'd just run across Greenbow County.

1737
01:53:00,459 --> 01:53:02,893
这时我想既然我跑了那么远
Now, I figured since I'd run this far,

1738
01:53:02,961 --> 01:53:06,829
也许我可以跑遍亚拉巴马州
maybe I'd just run across the great state of Alabama.

1739
01:53:06,899 --> 01:53:08,833
我就这么做了
And that's what I did.

1740
01:53:08,902 --> 01:53:10,893
我横越整个亚拉巴马
I ran clear across Alabama.

1741
01:53:10,970 --> 01:53:15,498
不知什么原因 我继续跑
No particular reason. I just kept on going.

1742
01:53:15,575 --> 01:53:17,509
我一直跑到大海
I ran clear to the ocean.

1743
01:53:22,750 --> 01:53:24,342
当我到达那里
And when I got there,

1744
01:53:24,418 --> 01:53:26,852
我想既然我跑了那么远
I figured since I'd gone this far,

1745
01:53:26,921 --> 01:53:30,084
也许不如掉头继续跑
might as well turn around, just keep on going.

1746
01:53:32,127 --> 01:53:35,187
然后当我跑到另一个大海
And when I got to another ocean,

1747
01:53:35,263 --> 01:53:38,198
我想既然我跑了那么远…
I figured since I'd gone this far...

1748
01:53:40,103 --> 01:53:42,401
我也许不如掉头
I might as well just turn back

1749
01:53:42,472 --> 01:53:44,064
继续跑下去
and keep right on going.

1750
01:53:44,140 --> 01:53:47,473
当我累了 我就睡觉
when I got tired, I slept.

1751
01:53:47,544 --> 01:53:49,637
当我饿了 我就吃饭
when I got hungry, I ate.

1752
01:53:49,713 --> 01:53:52,147
当我想去…
When I had to go...

1753
01:53:52,216 --> 01:53:53,240
你知道…
you know...

1754
01:53:54,385 --> 01:53:55,545
我就去
I went.

1755
01:53:55,619 --> 01:53:56,813
所以…
And so...

1756
01:53:56,888 --> 01:53:58,913
你不停地跑?
you just ran?

1757
01:54:00,558 --> 01:54:02,116
对
Yeah.

1758
01:54:02,193 --> 01:54:05,890
“看着路在车轮下延伸”
# Lookin' out at the road rushin' under my wheels #

1759
01:54:09,068 --> 01:54:11,935
“看着一年年时光飞逝”
# Lookin' back at the years gone by #

1760
01:54:12,004 --> 01:54:14,302
“就像一片片夏日农田”
# Like so many summer fields #

1761
01:54:15,909 --> 01:54:19,140
“六五年那时我十七岁”
# In '65, I was 17 #

1762
01:54:19,212 --> 01:54:21,646
“我在一刻不停地奔跑”
# And runnin' up one on one #

1763
01:54:23,083 --> 01:54:25,677
“我不知道跑到了何处”
# I don't know where I'm runnin' now #

1764
01:54:25,753 --> 01:54:28,847
“我只是在不停地奔跑”
# I'm just runnin' on #

1765
01:54:28,923 --> 01:54:30,686
“奔跑”
# Runnin' on #

1766
01:54:30,758 --> 01:54:32,692
“无缘无故地奔跑”
# Runnin' on empty #

1767
01:54:32,760 --> 01:54:34,159
“奔跑”
# Runnin' on #

1768
01:54:34,228 --> 01:54:36,025
“精疲力竭”
# Runnin' dry #

1769
01:54:36,098 --> 01:54:37,030
“奔跑…”
# Runnin' on... #

1770
01:54:37,099 --> 01:54:38,691
我想了很多事…
I'd think a lot...

1771
01:54:38,767 --> 01:54:43,033
关于妈妈和布巴还有丹中尉
about Mama and Bubba and Lieutenant Dan.

1772
01:54:43,105 --> 01:54:44,629
但最经常的
But most of all,

1773
01:54:44,706 --> 01:54:46,697
我在想念珍妮
I thought about Jenny.

1774
01:54:46,776 --> 01:54:49,540
我非常想念她
I thought about her a lot.

1775
01:54:51,014 --> 01:54:52,606
两年多来
For more than two years,

1776
01:54:52,682 --> 01:54:54,411
一位名叫福雷斯甘的人
a man named Forrest Gump,

1777
01:54:54,484 --> 01:54:57,476
来自亚拉巴马绿茵县的园艺师 除了睡觉

1778

01:55:02,059 --> 01:55:03,321

进行横越美国的旅程
on his journey across America,

1782
01:55:05,063 --> 01:55:07,497
福雷斯甘 来自亚拉巴马绿茵县的园艺师

1783
01:55:07,566 --> 01:55:10,330
今天将再次跑过密西西比河

1784
01:55:10,402 --> 01:55:11,835
天那 福雷斯？
I'll be damned. Forrest?

1785
01:55:11,903 --> 01:55:13,837
先生 你为什么要跑？
Sir, where are you running?

1786
01:55:13,905 --> 01:55:16,339
你是为了世界和平吗？
Are you doing this for world peace?

1787
01:55:16,409 --> 01:55:18,843
你是为了无家可者吗？
Are you doing this for the homeless?

1788
01:55:18,911 --> 01:55:20,845
你是为了妇女权利吗？
Are you running for women's rights?

1789

为了保护环境吗？
The environment?

1790
01:55:21,914 --> 01:55:23,176
他们就是不相信
they just couldn't believe

1791
01:55:23,249 --> 01:55:25,683
有些人跑步
that Somebody would do all that running

1792
01:55:25,752 --> 01:55:27,185
什么都不为
for no particular reason.

1793
01:55:27,254 --> 01:55:28,846
你为什么这样做？
Why are you doing this?

1794
01:55:28,922 --> 01:55:31,186
我只是想跑
I just felt like running.

1795
01:55:31,258 --> 01:55:32,885
我只是想跑
I just felt like runnin'.

1796
01:55:33,962 --> 01:55:34,894
是你
That's you.

1797
01:55:34,963 --> 01:55:37,557
我不敢相信真的是你
I can't believe it's really you.

1798
01:55:37,632 --> 01:55:39,065
然后…不知什么原因
Now...for some reason,

1799
01:55:39,133 --> 01:55:41,567
我所做的事好像
what I was doing seemed to...

1800
01:55:41,636 --> 01:55:43,160
在某些人看来有了意义
make sense to people.

1801
01:55:43,238 --> 01:55:46,173
我的头脑中好像响起一声警报
It was like an alarm went off in my head.

1802
01:55:46,242 --> 01:55:49,268
我说 “他是个实干家 
I said, "Here's a guy that's got his act together.

1803
01:55:49,345 --> 01:55:51,279
他拥有所有问题的答案”
Here's somebody who has the answer."

1804
01:55:51,347 --> 01:55:53,281
我要追随你 甘先生
I'll follow you anywhere, Mr. Gump.

1805
01:55:53,350 --> 01:55:55,682
于是我有了伙伴
So I got company.

1806
01:55:57,220 --> 01:55:59,780
然后 我有了更多的伙伴
And after that, I got more company.

1807
01:55:59,856 --> 01:56:03,383
然后 又有更多的人加入
And then, even more people joined in.

1808
01:56:05,396 --> 01:56:07,077
有人后来告诉我
Somebody later told me

1809
01:56:07,210 --> 01:56:08,768
人们看到了希望
it gave people hope.

1810
01:56:10,347 --> 01:56:11,507
那时…
Now...

1811
01:56:11,581 --> 01:56:14,072
那时我什么也不知道
Now, I don't know anything about that,

1812
01:56:14,151 --> 01:56:16,585
有些人曾经问我
but some of those people asked me

1813
01:56:16,654 --> 01:56:18,588
我能不能帮助他们
if I could help them out.

1814
01:56:18,656 --> 01:56:21,090
我想你也许能够帮助我
I was wondering if you might help me.

1815
01:56:21,158 --> 01:56:23,092
我是做贴纸生意的
I'm in the bumper sticker business.

1816
01:56:23,161 --> 01:56:24,753
我需要一句好的口号
I need a good slogan,

1817
01:56:24,830 --> 01:56:26,764
你很有天才
and since you've been so inspirational,

1818
01:56:26,832 --> 01:56:29,426
我想你也许能帮助我…
I thought you might be able to help me...

1819
01:56:29,501 --> 01:56:31,264
啊！你刚跑过…
Whoa, man! You just ran

1820
01:56:31,336 --> 01:56:33,634
一大堆狗屎！
through a big pile of dog shit!

1821
01:56:34,874 --> 01:56:36,466
不管它
It happens.

1822
01:56:36,542 --> 01:56:37,907
什么 狗屎？
What, shit?

1823
01:56:38,978 --> 01:56:40,275
有时
Sometimes.

1824
01:56:42,716 --> 01:56:45,184
几年后 我听说那个家伙
And some years later, I heard that that fella

1825
01:56:45,252 --> 01:56:47,516
想出来一条贴纸口号
did come up with a bumper sticker slogan

1826
01:56:47,588 --> 01:56:50,853
赚了一大笔钱
and made a lot of money off of it.

1827
01:56:50,924 --> 01:56:52,858
还有一次 我一个人跑着
Another time, I was running along.

1828
01:56:52,927 --> 01:56:55,862
遇到个卖T恤衫赔了本的人
Somebody who'd lost all his money in the T-shirt business,

1829
01:56:55,930 --> 01:56:59,366
他希望把我的脸印在T恤衫上
he wanted to put my face on a T-shirt,

1830
01:56:59,434 --> 01:57:01,368
但他不太会画画
but he couldn't draw that well,

1831
01:57:01,436 --> 01:57:03,370
他也没带照相机
and he didn't have a camera.

1832
01:57:03,439 --> 01:57:06,875
用这个吧 反正没人喜欢这颜色
Here, use this one. Nobody likes that color anyway.

1833
01:57:11,180 --> 01:57:13,080
祝你过得好
Have a nice day.

1834
01:57:14,684 --> 01:57:16,618
几年后 我听说
Someyears later, I found out

1835
01:57:16,686 --> 01:57:20,122
那个人确实想出了一个T恤图案
that that man did come up with an idea for a T-shirt.

1836
01:57:20,190 --> 01:57:22,351
赚了一大笔钱
He made a lot of money.

1837
01:57:24,695 --> 01:57:26,629
总之 就像我说过的
Anyway, like I was saying,

1838
01:57:26,697 --> 01:57:29,632
我有了很多伙伴
I had a lot of company.

1839
01:57:29,700 --> 01:57:31,133
我妈妈总是说
My mama always said,

1840
01:57:31,203 --> 01:57:34,138
“你得丢开以往的事
"You got to put the past behind you

1841
01:57:34,206 --> 01:57:36,640
“才能不断继续前进”
before you can move on. "

1842
01:57:36,708 --> 01:57:40,644
我想那就是我这次跑步的意义了
And I think that's what my running was all about.

1843
01:57:42,048 --> 01:57:44,642
我跑了三年…
I had run for three years...

1844
01:57:44,717 --> 01:57:46,651
两个月…
two months....

1845
01:57:46,719 --> 01:57:48,812
14天又16小时

我不知道
I don't know.

1978
02:08:01,721 --> 02:08:03,780
当雨停的时候
Sometimes it would stop raining

1979
02:08:03,857 --> 02:08:07,258
有时能看到星星…
long enough for the stars to come out...

1980
02:08:10,197 --> 02:08:12,131
那感觉很好
and then it was nice.

1981
02:08:15,404 --> 02:08:18,464
就像太阳下山前
It was like just before the sun goes to bed

1982
02:08:18,540 --> 02:08:19,939
在拉巴特湾
down on the bayou.

1983
02:08:20,008 --> 02:08:24,741
海面的闪闪鳞光…
there was always a million sparkles on the water...

1984
02:08:26,549 --> 02:08:28,676
就像山间的湖水
like that mountain lake.

那样的清澈 珍妮
It was so clear, Jenny,

1986
02:08:30,753 --> 02:08:33,688
就像另一片天空
it looked like there were two skies

1987
02:08:33,756 --> 02:08:35,690
两重天空
one on top of the other.

1988
02:08:37,394 --> 02:08:40,761
还有在沙漠里 当太阳升起…
And then in the desert, when the sun comes up...

1989
02:08:43,233 --> 02:08:44,666
我分不清
I couldn't tell

1990
02:08:44,736 --> 02:08:50,538
哪儿是天 哪儿是地
where heaven stopped and the earth began.

你确实在的
You were.

1994
02:09:16,604 --> 02:09:18,299
我爱你
I love you.

1995
02:09:22,377 --> 02:09:25,505
你在星期六清晨死去
You died on a Saturday morning.

1996
02:09:27,383 --> 02:09:31,479
我把你葬在我们的树下
And I had you placed here under our tree.

1997
02:09:35,892 --> 02:09:39,328
我把你父亲的房子
And I had that house of your father's

1998
02:09:39,396 --> 02:09:41,660
推成了平地
bulldozed to the ground.

1999
02:09:44,902 --> 02:09:46,096
妈妈…
Mama...

2000
02:09:47,238 --> 02:09:49,172
总是说…
always said

2001
02:09:49,240 --> 02:09:53,336
死亡是生命的一部分
that dyin' was a part of life .

2002
02:09:55,914 --> 02:09:57,677

I sure wish it wasn't.

2003
02:10:01,086 --> 02:10:02,610
小福雷斯…
Little Forrest is...

2004
02:10:03,923 --> 02:10:06,187
很好
doing just fine.

2005
02:10:06,259 --> 02:10:07,248
“不过…”
"But..."

2006
02:10:07,326 --> 02:10:09,760
就要去上学了
About to start school again so on,

2007
02:10:09,829 --> 02:10:11,854
还有…
and...

2008
02:10:11,931 --> 02:10:15,196
我给他做早餐、午餐和晚餐
and I make his breakfast, lunch, and dinner

2009
02:10:15,269 --> 02:10:16,327
每天
every day.

2010
02:10:18,105 --> 02:10:19,697
我让他…
I make sure he...

2011
02:10:21,108 --> 02:10:22,541
梳头
combs his hair

2012
02:10:22,610 --> 02:10:24,703
让他每天刷牙
and brushes his teeth every day.

2013
02:10:26,948 --> 02:10:29,508
教他怎么打乒乓球
Teaching him how to play Ping-Pong.

2014
02:10:31,787 --> 02:10:33,220
他打得很棒
He's really good.

2015
02:10:33,289 --> 02:10:35,382
福雷斯 你来发球
Uh, Forrest, you go.

2016
02:10:39,962 --> 02:10:41,395
我们经常钓鱼
We fish a lot.

2017
02:10:44,801 --> 02:10:47,167
我们每天晚上读书
And every night, we read a book.

2018
02:10:47,237 --> 02:10:48,670
他聪明极了 珍妮
He's so smart, Jenny.

2019
02:10:51,742 --> 02:10:53,835
你一定会为他骄傲
You'd be so proud of him.

2020
02:10:55,580 --> 02:10:56,842
我会的
I am.

2021
02:10:58,249 --> 02:11:01,412
他还给你写了封信
He, uh, wrote you a...a letter.

2022
02:11:02,754 --> 02:11:05,689
他说不许我看 我不能看
And he says I can't read it. I'm not supposed to,

2023
02:11:05,757 --> 02:11:08,692
所以我把它放在这儿给你
so I'll just leave it here for you.

2024
02:11:24,945 --> 02:11:26,846
珍妮…
Jenny...

2025
02:11:31,752 --> 02:11:34,687
我不知道是妈妈对
I don't know if Mama was right

2026
02:11:34,755 --> 02:11:37,849
还是丹中尉对
or if it...it's Lieutenant Dan.

2027
02:11:37,924 --> 02:11:39,789
我不知道
I don't know...

2028
02:11:40,928 --> 02:11:43,590
是否我们每个人都有
if we each have a...

2029
02:11:44,766 --> 02:11:45,892
注定的命运…
destiny...

2030
02:11:47,368 --> 02:11:51,134
还是我们的生命中只有偶然
or if we're all just floating around accidental-Iike

2031
02:11:51,206 --> 02:11:52,639
像在风中飘…
on a breeze...

2032
02:11:56,879 --> 02:11:58,813
但我想…
but I...I think...

2033
02:12:00,717 --> 02:12:02,480
也许两者都有吧
maybe it's both.

2034
02:12:06,723 --> 02:12:09,954
也许两者都在同时发生着
Maybe both get happening at the same time.

2035
02:12:15,733 --> 02:12:17,667
可是我想念你 珍妮
But I miss you, Jenny.

2036
02:12:24,242 --> 02:12:26,233
如果你想要什么…
If there's anything you need...

2037
02:12:27,412 --> 02:12:29,346
我就在你身边
I won't be far away.

2038
02:13:03,719 --> 02:13:06,153
你的车来了
Here's your bus.

2039
02:13:06,222 --> 02:13:07,587
好吧
O.K.

2040
02:13:07,656 --> 02:13:10,147
嗨…
Hey...

2041
02:13:10,227 --> 02:13:11,660
我知道
I know this.

2042
02:13:11,728 --> 02:13:14,162
我会在故事会上讲故事
I'm gonna share that for show-and-tell

2043
02:13:14,231 --> 02:13:17,394
因为奶奶曾给你读过
because Grandma used to read it to you.

2044
02:13:17,467 --> 02:13:19,526
我最喜欢的书
My favorite book.

2045
02:13:23,007 --> 02:13:24,440

2047
02:13:27,746 --> 02:13:29,179
你该走了
here you go.

2048
02:13:34,353 --> 02:13:35,911
嘿 福雷斯…
Hey, Forrest...

2049
02:13:35,988 --> 02:13:37,455
不要…
don't...

2050
02:13:40,260 --> 02:13:42,785
我想告诉你我爱你
I want to tell you I love you.

2051
02:13:42,862 --> 02:13:44,830
我也爱你 爸爸
I love you, too, Daddy.

2052
02:13:44,898 --> 02:13:47,765
我就在这儿等你回来
I'll be right here when you get back.

2053
02:13:53,207 --> 02:13:56,643
你知道这是校车 是吧？
You understand this is the bus to school, now, don't you?

2054
02:13:56,711 --> 02:14:00,477
当然 你是多萝西哈里斯 我是福雷斯甘
Of course, and you're Dorothy Harris, and I'm Forrest Gump.
