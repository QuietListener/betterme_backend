1
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:04,254
嘿 布巴 是我 福雷斯甘
Hey, Bubba. It's me, Forrest Gump.

2
00:00:07,598 --> 00:00:09,526
我记得你说过的话
I remember everything you said,

3
00:00:09,597 --> 00:00:12,457
我已经安排好了
and I got it all figured out.

4
00:00:14,128 --> 00:00:20,747
我带来两万四千五百六十二块四毛七分
I'm taking $24,562.47

5
00:00:20,824 --> 00:00:22,945
这是我所有的钱
that I got, that's left

6
00:00:23,024 --> 00:00:25,451
其它钱用来理发和买新衣服
after a new hair cut and a new suit

7
00:00:25,522 --> 00:00:28,452
还有带妈妈上街吃了一顿好饭
and took Mama out to a real fancy dinner,

8
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:31,380
还买了车票 还买了三瓶汽水
and I bought a bus ticket, then three Dr. Peppers.

9
00:00:31,452 --> 00:00:33,438
告诉我
Tell me something.

10
00:00:33,518 --> 00:00:35,945
你是傻瓜吗？
Are you stupid or something?

11
00:00:36,017 --> 00:00:38,705
做傻事的才是傻瓜 先生
Stupid is as stupid does, sir.

12
00:00:38,783 --> 00:00:40,711
我拿到这些钱是因为我说：
That's what's left after me saying,

13
00:00:40,782 --> 00:00:44,710
“我和全美乒乓球队在中国时
"When I was in China on the all-America Ping-Pong team,

14
00:00:44,779 --> 00:00:46,707
“我最喜欢打乒乓球…
"I just loved playing Ping-Pong

15
00:00:46,779 --> 00:00:48,900
“用我的菲利奥莱乒乓球拍”
with my Flex-O-Lite Ping-Pong paddle,"

16
00:00:48,976 --> 00:00:50,904
谁都知道这不是真话
which everybody knows isn't true,

17
00:00:50,975 --> 00:00:53,905
但妈妈说它只是一个善意的谎话
but Mama said it was just a little white lie,

18
00:00:53,974 --> 00:00:55,902
它不会伤害任何人
so it wasn't hurting nobody.

19
00:00:55,974 --> 00:00:58,401
总之 剩下的钱我全部用来
So anyway, I'm putting all that

20
00:00:58,473 --> 00:01:00,900
买燃料、绳索和网具
on gas, ropes, and new nets

21
00:01:00,972 --> 00:01:03,901
以及一条全新的捕虾船
and a brand-new shrimping boat.
