1
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:05,891
你在越南害怕过吗？
were you scared in Vietnam?

2
00:00:07,239 --> 00:00:09,002
是的
Yes.

3
00:00:09,074 --> 00:00:10,666
我…
Well, I...

4
00:00:10,742 --> 00:00:12,869
我不知道
I don't know.

5
00:00:12,944 --> 00:00:15,003
当雨停的时候
Sometimes it would stop raining

6
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:18,481
有时能看到星星…
long enough for the stars to come out...

7
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:23,354
那感觉很好
and then it was nice.

8
00:00:26,627 --> 00:00:29,687
就像太阳下山前
It was like just before the sun goes to bed

9
00:00:29,763 --> 00:00:31,162
在拉巴特湾
down on the bayou.

10
00:00:31,231 --> 00:00:35,964
海面的闪闪鳞光…
there was always a million sparkles on the water...

11
00:00:37,772 --> 00:00:39,899
就像山间的湖水
like that mountain lake.

12
00:00:39,974 --> 00:00:41,908
那样的清澈 珍妮
It was so clear, Jenny,

13
00:00:41,976 --> 00:00:44,911
就像另一片天空
it looked like there were two skies

14
00:00:44,979 --> 00:00:46,913
两重天空
one on top of the other.

15
00:00:48,617 --> 00:00:51,984
还有在沙漠里 当太阳升起…
And then in the desert, when the sun comes up...

16
00:00:54,456 --> 00:00:55,889
我分不清
I couldn't tell

17
00:00:55,959 --> 00:01:01,761
哪儿是天 哪儿是地
where heaven stopped and the earth began.

18
00:01:03,066 --> 00:01:05,227
真是美丽
It's so beautiful.

19
00:01:09,307 --> 00:01:12,333
我但愿那时和你在一起
I wish I could've been there with you.
