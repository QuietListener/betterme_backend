1
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:05,358
那一天
That day,

2
00:00:05,425 --> 00:00:06,858
不知什么原因
for no particular reason,

3
00:00:06,927 --> 00:00:09,919
我决定出去跑一趟
I decided to go for a little run.

4
00:00:09,996 --> 00:00:13,454
所以我跑到路的尽头
So I ran to the end of the road,

5
00:00:13,534 --> 00:00:16,867
当我到达那里 我想也许我能跑到城边
and when I got there, I thought maybe I'd run to the end of town.

6
00:00:16,938 --> 00:00:19,566
卡特总统因中暑病倒…
President Carter, suffering from heat exhaustion...

7
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:21,631
而当我到达那里
And when I got there,

8
00:00:21,709 --> 00:00:25,645
我想也许我能跑遍绿茵县
I thought maybe I'd just run across Greenbow County.

9
00:00:25,714 --> 00:00:28,148
这时我想既然我跑了那么远
Now, I figured since I'd run this far,

10
00:00:28,216 --> 00:00:32,084
也许我可以跑遍亚拉巴马州
maybe I'd just run across the great state of Alabama.

11
00:00:32,154 --> 00:00:34,088
我就这么做了
And that's what I did.

12
00:00:34,157 --> 00:00:36,148
我横越整个亚拉巴马
I ran clear across Alabama.

13
00:00:36,225 --> 00:00:40,753
不知什么原因 我继续跑
No particular reason. I just kept on going.

14
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:42,764
我一直跑到大海
I ran clear to the ocean.

15
00:00:48,005 --> 00:00:49,597
当我到达那里
And when I got there,

16
00:00:49,673 --> 00:00:52,107
我想既然我跑了那么远
I figured since I'd gone this far,

17
00:00:52,176 --> 00:00:55,339
也许不如掉头继续跑
might as well turn around, just keep on going.

18
00:00:57,382 --> 00:01:00,442
然后当我跑到另一个大海
And when I got to another ocean,

19
00:01:00,518 --> 00:01:03,453
我想既然我跑了那么远…
I figured since I'd gone this far...

20
00:01:05,358 --> 00:01:07,656
我也许不如掉头
I might as well just turn back

21
00:01:07,727 --> 00:01:09,319
继续跑下去
and keep right on going.

22
00:01:09,395 --> 00:01:12,728
当我累了 我就睡觉
when I got tired, I slept.

23
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:14,892
当我饿了 我就吃饭
when I got hungry, I ate.

24
00:01:14,968 --> 00:01:17,402
当我想去…
When I had to go...

25
00:01:17,471 --> 00:01:18,495
你知道…
you know...

26
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:20,800
我就去
I went.

27
00:01:20,874 --> 00:01:22,068
所以…
And so...

28
00:01:22,143 --> 00:01:24,168
你不停地跑?
you just ran?
