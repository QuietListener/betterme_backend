1
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:40,430
President Faust, Board of Overseers, faculty, alumni, friends, proud parents, members of

2
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:55,360
the ad board, and graduates of the greatest university in the world,

3
00:00:55,360 --> 00:01:00,660
I'm honored to be with you today because, let's face it, you accomplished something

4
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:04,190
I never could.

5
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:09,830
If I get through this speech, it'll be the first time I actually finish something at

6
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:11,260
Harvard.

7
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:16,570
Class of 2017, congratulations!

8
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:26,650
I'm an unlikely speaker, not just because I dropped out, but because we're technically

9
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:29,400
in the same generation.

10
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:35,010
We walked this yard less than a decade apart, studied the same ideas and slept through the

11
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:37,870
same Ec10 lectures.

12
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:43,150
We may have taken different paths to get here, especially if you came all the way from the

13
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:49,810
Quad, but today I want to share what I've learned about our generation and the world

14
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:51,830
we're building together.

15
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:57,500
But first, the last couple of days have brought back a lot of good memories.

16
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:03,600
How many of you remember exactly what you were doing when you got that email telling

17
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:13,140
you that you got into Harvard?

18
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:20,640
I was playing Civilization and I ran downstairs, got my dad, and for some reason, his reaction

19
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,650
was to video me opening the email.

20
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:28,310
That could have been a really sad video.

21
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:36,569
I swear getting into Harvard is still the thing my parents are most proud of me for.

22
00:02:36,569 --> 00:02:52,000
What about  your first lecture at Harvard?

23
00:02:52,000 --> 00:03:00,689
Mine was Computer Science 121 with the incredible Harry Lewis.

24
00:03:00,689 --> 00:03:07,389
I was late so I threw on a t-shirt and didn't realize until afterwards it was inside out

25
00:03:07,389 --> 00:03:10,609
and backwards with my tag sticking out the front.

26
00:03:10,609 --> 00:03:19,120
I couldn't figure out why no one would talk to me -- except one guy, KX Jin, he just went

27
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,180
with it.

28
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:25,290
We ended up doing our problem sets together, and now he runs a big part of Facebook.

29
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:34,669
And that, Class of 2017, is why you should be nice to people.

30
00:03:34,669 --> 00:03:44,159
But my best memory from Harvard was meeting Priscilla.

31
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:55,200
I had just launched this prank website Facemash, and the ad board wanted to "see me".

32
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,349
Everyone thought I was going to get kicked out.

33
00:03:57,349 --> 00:04:01,189
My parents came to help me pack.

34
00:04:01,189 --> 00:04:07,010
My friends threw me a going away party.

35
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:12,099
As luck would have it, Priscilla was at that party with her friend.

36
00:04:12,099 --> 00:04:16,960
We met in line for the bathroom in the Pfoho Belltower, and in what must be one of the

37
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:23,060
all time romantic lines, I said: "I'm going to get kicked out in three days, so we need

38
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:24,100
to go on a date quickly."

39
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:32,580
Actually, any of you graduating can use that line.

40
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:41,770
I didn't end up getting kicked out -- I did that to myself.

41
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:43,380
Priscilla and I started dating.

42
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:49,930
And, you know, that movie made it seem like Facemash was so important to creating Facebook.

43
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:51,590
It wasn't.

44
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:57,680
But without Facemash I wouldn't have met Priscilla, and she's the most important person in my

45
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:08,400
life, so you could say it was the most important thing I built in my time here.

46
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:20,199
We've all started lifelong friendships here, and some of us even families.

47
00:05:20,199 --> 00:05:24,540
That's why I'm so grateful to this place.

48
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:30,490
Thanks, Harvard.

49
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:34,970
Today I want to talk about purpose.

50
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:38,680
But I'm not here to give you the standard commencement about finding your purpose.

51
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,250
We're millennials.

52
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:42,830
We'll try to do that instinctively.

53
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:50,229
Instead, I'm here to tell you finding your purpose isn't enough.

54
00:05:50,229 --> 00:05:57,080
The challenge for our generation is creating a world where everyone has a sense of purpose.

55
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:04,680
One of my favorite stories is when John F Kennedy visited the NASA space center, he

56
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:07,870
saw a janitor carrying a broom and he walked over and asked what he was doing.

57
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:14,710
The janitor responded: "Mr. President, I'm helping put a man on the moon".

58
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:21,560
Purpose is that sense that we are part of something bigger than ourselves, that we are

59
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:26,169
needed, that we have something better ahead to work for.

60
00:06:26,169 --> 00:06:30,520
Purpose is what creates true happiness.

61
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:33,830
You're graduating at a time when this is especially important.

62
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:43,000
When our parents graduated, purpose reliably came from your job, your church, your community.

63
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:48,569
But today, technology and automation are eliminating many jobs.

64
00:06:48,569 --> 00:06:51,060
Membership in communities is declining.

65
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:57,990
Many people feel disconnected and depressed, and are trying to fill a void.

66
00:06:57,990 --> 00:07:03,439
As I've traveled around, I've sat with children in juvenile detention and opioid addicts,

67
00:07:03,439 --> 00:07:07,479
who told me their lives could have turned out differently if they just had something

68
00:07:07,479 --> 00:07:12,069
to do, an after school program or somewhere to go.

69
00:07:12,069 --> 00:07:15,909
I've met factory workers who know their old jobs aren't coming back and are trying to

70
00:07:15,909 --> 00:07:17,879
find their place.

71
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:25,460
To keep our society moving forward, we have a generational challenge -- to not only create

72
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:30,749
new jobs, but create a renewed sense of purpose.

73
00:07:30,749 --> 00:07:40,990
I remember the night I launched Facebook from my little dorm in Kirkland House.

74
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:44,930
I went to Noch's with my friend KX.

75
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:50,870
I remember telling him I was excited to connect the Harvard community, but one day someone

76
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:53,620
would connect the whole world.

77
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:57,409
The thing is, it never even occurred to me that someone might be us.

78
00:07:57,409 --> 00:07:58,919
We were just college kids.

79
00:07:58,919 --> 00:08:00,770
We didn't know anything about that.

80
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:04,380
There were all these big technology companies with resources.

81
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:07,199
I just assumed one of them would do it.

82
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:12,300
But this idea was so clear to us -- that all people want to connect.

83
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:17,020
So we just kept moving forward, day by day.

84
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:21,290
I know a lot of you will have your own stories just like this.

85
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:28,160
A change in the world that seems so clear you're sure someone else will do it.

86
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,430
But they won't.

87
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:31,440
You will.

88
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,909
But it's not enough to have purpose yourself.

89
00:08:34,909 --> 00:08:39,140
You have to create a sense of purpose for others.

90
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:41,200
I found that out the hard way.

91
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:47,600
You see, my hope was never to build a company, but to make an impact.

92
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:51,790
And as all these people started joining us, I just assumed that's what they cared about

93
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:57,450
too, so I never explained what I hoped we'd build.

94
00:08:57,450 --> 00:09:01,510
A couple years in, some big companies wanted to buy us.

95
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:03,130
I didn't want to sell.

96
00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:05,980
I wanted to see if we could connect more people.

97
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:11,171
We were building the first News Feed, and I thought if we could just launch this, it

98
00:09:11,171 --> 00:09:15,140
could change how we learn about the world.

99
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:18,840
Nearly everyone else wanted to sell.

100
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:23,390
Without a sense of higher purpose, this was the startup dream come true.

101
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:26,100
It tore our company apart.

102
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:33,290
After one tense argument, an advisor told me if I didn't agree to sell, I would regret

103
00:09:33,290 --> 00:09:37,080
the decision for the rest of my life.

104
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:42,870
Relationships were so frayed that within a year or so every single person on the management

105
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:46,830
team was gone.

106
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:50,760
That was my hardest time leading Facebook.

107
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:54,360
I believed in what we were doing, but I felt alone.

108
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:57,640
And worse, it was my fault.

109
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:05,580
I wondered if I was just wrong, an imposter, a 22 year-old kid who had no idea how the

110
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:07,580
world worked.

111
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:13,970
Now, years later, I understand that *is* how things work with no sense of higher purpose.

112
00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:20,820
It's up to us to create it so we can all keep moving forward together.

113
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:28,700
Today I want to talk about three ways to create a world where everyone has a sense of purpose:

114
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:35,380
by taking on big meaningful projects together, by redefining equality so everyone has the

115
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:41,950
freedom to pursue purpose, and by building community across the world.

116
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:47,590
First, let's take on big meaningful projects.

117
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:51,830
Our generation will have to deal with tens of millions of jobs replaced by automation

118
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:54,280
like self-driving cars and trucks.

119
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:58,200
But we have the potential to do so much more together.

120
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,980
Every generation has its defining works.

121
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:06,000
More than 300,000 people worked to put a man on the moon \'96 including that janitor.

122
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,790
Millions of volunteers immunized children around the world against polio.

123
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:12,631
Millions of more people built the Hoover dam and other great projects.

124
00:11:12,631 --> 00:11:13,740
These projects didn't just provide purpose for the people doing those jobs, they gave

125
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:14,740
our whole country a sense of pride that we could do great things.

126
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:18,140
Now it's our turn to do great things.

127
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:23,840
I know, you're probably thinking: I don't know how to build a dam, or get a million

128
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:26,180
people involved in anything.

129
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:33,700
But let me tell you a secret: no one does when they begin.

130
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:36,690
Ideas don't come out fully formed.

131
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:39,880
They only become clear as you work on them.

132
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:43,410
You just have to get started.

133
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:49,070
If I had to understand everything about connecting people before I began, I never would have

134
00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:50,870
started Facebook.

135
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:54,110
Movies and pop culture get this all wrong.

136
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:58,930
The idea of a single eureka moment is a dangerous lie.

137
00:11:58,930 --> 00:12:03,430
It makes us feel inadequate since we haven't had ours.

138
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:09,020
It prevents people with seeds of good ideas from getting started.

139
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:13,640
Oh, you know what else movies get wrong about innovation?

140
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:18,800
No one writes math formulas on glass.

141
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:23,200
That's not a thing.

142
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:28,640
It's good to be idealistic.

143
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:33,300
But be prepared to be misunderstood.

144
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:38,860
Anyone working on a big vision will get called crazy, even if you end up right.

145
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:44,060
Anyone working on a complex problem will get blamed for not fully understanding the challenge,

146
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:47,090
even though it's impossible to know everything upfront.

147
00:12:47,090 --> 00:12:53,020
Anyone taking initiative will get criticized for moving too fast, because there's always

148
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:55,890
someone who wants to slow you down.

149
00:12:55,890 --> 00:13:02,930
In our society, we often don't do big things because we're so afraid of making mistakes

150
00:13:02,930 --> 00:13:07,860
that we ignore all the things wrong today if we do nothing.

151
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:14,230
The reality is, anything we do will have issues in the future.

152
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:19,440
But that can't keep us from starting.

153
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,260
So what are we waiting for?

154
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:25,890
It's time for our generation-defining public works.

155
00:13:25,890 --> 00:13:30,240
How about stopping climate change before we destroy the planet and getting millions of

156
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:37,000
people involved manufacturing and installing solar panels?

157
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:43,760
How about curing all diseases and asking volunteers to track their health data and share their

158
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,450
genomes?

159
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:53,850
Today we spend 50x more treating people who are sick than we spend finding cures so people

160
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:55,270
don't get sick in the first place.

161
00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:58,220
That makes no sense.

162
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:00,280
We can fix this.

163
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:10,820
How about modernizing democracy so everyone can vote online, and personalizing education

164
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:13,520
so everyone can learn?

165
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:18,040
These achievements are within our reach.

166
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:23,450
Let's do them all in a way that gives everyone in our society a role.

167
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:36,100
Let's do big things, not only to create progress, but to create purpose.

168
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:41,070
So taking on big meaningful projects is the first thing we can do to create a world where

169
00:14:41,070 --> 00:14:43,720
everyone has a sense of purpose.

170
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:54,080
The second is redefining equality to give everyone the freedom they need to pursue purpose.

171
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:57,290
Many of our parents had stable jobs throughout their careers.

172
00:14:57,290 --> 00:15:03,520
Now we're all entrepreneurial, whether we're starting projects or finding or role.

173
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:05,230
And that's great.

174
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:09,920
Our culture of entrepreneurship is how we create so much progress.

175
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:17,660
Now, an entrepreneurial culture thrives when it's easy to try lots of new ideas.

176
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:20,050
Facebook wasn't the first thing I built.

177
00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:24,370
I also built games, chat systems, study tools and music players.

178
00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:25,560
I'm not alone.

179
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:32,700
JK Rowling got rejected 12 times before publishing Harry Potter.

180
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:41,320
Even Beyonce had to make hundreds of songs to get Halo.

181
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:47,480
The greatest successes come from having the freedom to fail.

182
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:58,410
But today, we have a level of wealth inequality that hurts everyone.

183
00:15:58,410 --> 00:16:05,140
When you don't have the freedom to take your idea and turn it into a historic enterprise,

184
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:07,670
we all lose.

185
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:14,420
Right now our society is way over-indexed on rewarding success and we don't do nearly

186
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:19,180
enough to make it easy for everyone to take lots of shots.

187
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:20,720
Let's face it.

188
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:26,410
There is something wrong with our system when I can leave here and make billions of dollars

189
00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:31,990
in 10 years while millions of students can't afford to pay off their loans, let alone start

190
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:36,670
a business.

191
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:46,510
Look, I know a lot of entrepreneurs, and I don't know a single person who gave up on

192
00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:51,130
starting a business because they might not make enough money.

193
00:16:51,130 --> 00:16:56,510
But I know lots of people who haven't pursued dreams because they didn't have a cushion

194
00:16:56,510 --> 00:17:04,640
to fall back on if they failed.

195
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:09,170
We all know we don't succeed just by having a good idea or working hard.

196
00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:13,260
We succeed by being lucky too.

197
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:19,339
If I had to support my family growing up instead of having time to code, if I didn't know I'd

198
00:17:19,339 --> 00:17:25,089
be fine if Facebook didn't work out, I wouldn't be standing here today.

199
00:17:25,089 --> 00:17:33,070
If we're honest, we all know how much luck we've had.

200
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:38,470
Every generation expands its definition of equality.

201
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:42,450
Previous generations fought for the vote and civil rights.

202
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:46,480
They had the New Deal and Great Society.

203
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:57,660
Now it's our time to define a new social contract for our generation.

204
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:04,190
We should have a society that measures progress not just by economic metrics like GDP, but

205
00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:07,890
by how many of us have a role we find meaningful.

206
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:13,380
We should explore ideas like universal basic income to give everyone a cushion to try new

207
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:15,770
things.

208
00:18:15,770 --> 00:18:22,070
We\'92re going to change jobs many times, so we need affordable childcare to get to

209
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:30,020
work and healthcare that aren't tied to one company.

210
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:34,700
We're all going to make mistakes, so we need a society that focuses less on locking us

211
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:38,290
up or stigmatizing us.

212
00:18:38,290 --> 00:18:45,140
And as technology keeps changing, we need to focus more on continuous education throughout

213
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:54,120
our lives.\ And yes, giving everyone the freedom to pursue

214
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:57,400
purpose isn't free.

215
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:59,200
People like me should pay for it.

216
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:06,760
Many of you will do well and you should too.

217
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:16,160
That's why Priscilla and I started the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative and committed our wealth

218
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:20,920
to promoting equal opportunity.

219
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:27,210
These are the values of our generation.

220
00:19:27,210 --> 00:19:31,540
It was never a question of if we were going to do this.

221
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:34,570
The only question was when.

222
00:19:34,570 --> 00:19:39,270
Millennials are already one of the most charitable generations in history.

223
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:46,480
In one year, three of four US millennials made a donation and seven out of ten raised

224
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,960
money for charity.

225
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:52,110
But it's not just about money.

226
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:54,470
You can also give time.

227
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:59,970
I promise you, if you take an hour or two a week -- that's all it takes to give someone

228
00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:02,300
a hand, to help them reach their potential.

229
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:08,580
Maybe you think that's too much time.

230
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:11,240
I used to.

231
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:16,110
When Priscilla graduated from Harvard she became a teacher, and before she'd do education

232
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:21,970
work with me, she told me I needed to teach a class.

233
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:25,780
I complained: "Well, I'm kind of busy.

234
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:28,890
I'm running this company."

235
00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:35,760
But she insisted, so I taught a middle school program on entrepreneurship at the local Boys

236
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:40,390
and Girls Club.

237
00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:45,950
I taught them lessons on product development and marketing, and they taught me what it's

238
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:54,360
like feeling targeted for your race and having a family member in prison.

239
00:20:54,360 --> 00:21:01,760
I shared stories from my time in school, and they shared their hope of one day going to

240
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,630
college too.

241
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:11,480
For five years now, I\'92ve been having dinner with those kids every month.

242
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:15,710
One of them threw me and Priscilla our first baby shower.

243
00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:18,430
And next year they\'92re going to college.

244
00:21:18,430 --> 00:21:23,620
Every one of them.

245
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:26,960
First in their families.

246
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:30,840
We can all make time to give someone a hand.

247
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:34,840
Let's give everyone the freedom to pursue their purpose -- not only because it's the

248
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:39,100
right thing to do, but because when more people can turn their dreams into something great,

249
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:49,990
we're all better for it.

250
00:21:49,990 --> 00:21:53,580
Purpose doesn't only come from work.

251
00:21:53,580 --> 00:22:00,240
The third way we can create a sense of purpose for everyone is by building community.

252
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:07,620
And when our generation says "everyone", we mean everyone in the world.

253
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:13,950
Quick show of hands: how many of you are from another country?

254
00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:21,580
Now, how many of you are friends with one of these folks?

255
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:23,809
Now we're talking.

256
00:22:23,809 --> 00:22:29,900
We have grown up connected.\ In a survey asking millennials around the

257
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:37,630
world what defines our identity, the most popular answer wasn't nationality, religion

258
00:22:37,630 --> 00:22:41,890
or ethnicity, it was "citizen of the world".

259
00:22:41,890 --> 00:22:44,760
That's a big deal.

260
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:49,630
Every generation expands the circle of people we consider "one of us".

261
00:22:49,630 --> 00:22:56,270
For us, it now encompasses the entire world.

262
00:22:56,270 --> 00:23:02,320
We understand the great arc of human history bends towards people coming together in ever

263
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:08,070
greater numbers -- from tribes to cities to nations -- to achieve things we couldn't on

264
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:09,930
our own.

265
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:14,420
We get that our greatest opportunities are now global -- we can be the generation that

266
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:18,570
ends poverty, that ends disease.

267
00:23:18,570 --> 00:23:24,180
We get that our greatest challenges need global responses too -- no country can fight climate

268
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:27,990
change alone or prevent pandemics.

269
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:34,610
Progress now requires coming together not just as cities or nations, but also as a global

270
00:23:34,610 --> 00:23:37,500
community.

271
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:40,980
But we live in an unstable time.

272
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:46,290
There are people left behind by globalization across the world.

273
00:23:46,290 --> 00:23:51,090
It's hard to care about people in other places if we don't feel good about our lives here

274
00:23:51,090 --> 00:23:53,670
at home.

275
00:23:53,670 --> 00:23:56,940
There's pressure to turn inwards.

276
00:23:56,940 --> 00:24:00,020
This is the struggle of our time.

277
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:06,760
The forces of freedom, openness and global community against the forces of authoritarianism,

278
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:09,900
isolationism and nationalism.

279
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:16,030
Forces for the flow of knowledge, trade and immigration against those who would slow them

280
00:24:16,030 --> 00:24:18,520
down.

281
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:25,010
This is not a battle of nations, it's a battle of ideas.

282
00:24:25,010 --> 00:24:32,040
There are people in every country for global connection and good people against it.

283
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:35,520
This isn't going to be decided at the UN either.

284
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:42,190
It's going to happen at the local level, when enough of us feel a sense of purpose and stability

285
00:24:42,190 --> 00:24:47,280
in our own lives that we can open up and start caring about everyone.

286
00:24:47,280 --> 00:25:05,250
The best way to do that is to start building local communities right now.

287
00:25:05,250 --> 00:25:27,929
We all get meaning from our communities.

288
00:25:27,929 --> 00:25:33,420
Whether our communities are houses or sports teams, churches or music groups, they give

289
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:39,800
us that sense we are part of something bigger, that we are not alone; they give us the strength

290
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:43,120
to expand our horizons.

291
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:50,520
That's why it's so striking that for decades, membership in all kinds of groups has declined

292
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:52,500
as much as one-quarter.

293
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:56,340
That's a lot of people who now need to find purpose somewhere else.

294
00:25:56,340 --> 00:26:02,809
But I know we can rebuild our communities and start new ones because many of you already

295
00:26:02,809 --> 00:26:05,710
are.

296
00:26:05,710 --> 00:26:10,559
I met Agnes Igoye, who's graduating today.

297
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:15,510
Where are you, Agnes?

298
00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:24,580
She spent her childhood navigating conflict zones in Uganda, and now she trains thousands

299
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:36,150
of law enforcement officers to keep communities safe.

300
00:26:36,150 --> 00:26:41,730
I met Kayla Oakley and Niha Jain, graduating today, too.

301
00:26:41,730 --> 00:26:43,770
Stand up.

302
00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:51,300
Kayla and Niha started a non-profit that connects people suffering from illnesses with people

303
00:26:51,300 --> 00:27:04,440
in their communities willing to help.

304
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:07,200
I met David Razu Aznar, graduating from the Kennedy School today.

305
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:10,620
David, stand up.

306
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:18,770
He's a former city councilor who successfully led the battle to make Mexico City the first

307
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:30,870
Latin American city to pass marriage equality -- even before San Francisco.

308
00:27:30,870 --> 00:27:33,530
This is my story too.

309
00:27:33,530 --> 00:27:41,640
A student in a dorm room, connecting one community at a time, and keeping at it until one day

310
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:46,360
we connect the whole world.

311
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:49,470
Change starts local.

312
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:54,370
Even global changes start small -- with people like us.

313
00:27:54,370 --> 00:28:00,290
In our generation, the struggle of whether we connect more, whether we achieve our biggest

314
00:28:00,290 --> 00:28:07,550
opportunities, comes down to this -- your ability to build communities and create a

315
00:28:07,550 --> 00:28:22,330
world where every single person has a sense of purpose.

316
00:28:22,330 --> 00:28:30,000
Class of 2017, you are graduating into a world that needs purpose.

317
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,690
It's up to you to create it.

318
00:28:32,690 --> 00:28:42,710
Now, you may be thinking: can I really do this?

319
00:28:42,710 --> 00:28:47,679
Remember when I told you about that class I taught at the Boys and Girls Club?

320
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:53,460
One day after class I was talking to them about college, and one of my top students

321
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:59,400
raised his hand and said he wasn't sure he could go because he's undocumented.

322
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:03,220
He didn't know if they'd let him in.

323
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:07,360
Last year I took him out to breakfast for his birthday.

324
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:13,200
I wanted to get him a present, so I asked him and he started talking about students

325
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:22,770
he saw struggling and said "You know, I'd really just like a book on social justice."

326
00:29:22,770 --> 00:29:25,040
I was blown away.

327
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:31,850
Here's a young guy who has every reason to be cynical.

328
00:29:31,850 --> 00:29:39,440
He didn't know if the country he calls home -- the only one he's known -- would deny him

329
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:43,640
his dream of going to college.

330
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:45,750
But he wasn't feeling sorry for himself.

331
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:49,690
He wasn't even thinking of himself.

332
00:29:49,690 --> 00:29:58,360
He has a greater sense of purpose, and he's going to bring people along with him.

333
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:02,961
It says something about our current situation that I can't even say his name because I don't

334
00:30:02,961 --> 00:30:07,070
want to put him at risk.

335
00:30:07,070 --> 00:30:13,250
But if a high school senior who doesn't know what the future holds can do his part to move

336
00:30:13,250 --> 00:30:46,290
the world forward, then we owe it to the world to do our part too.

337
00:30:46,290 --> 00:30:54,960
Before you walk out those gates one last time, as we sit in front of Memorial Church, I am

338
00:30:54,960 --> 00:31:04,510
reminded of a prayer, Mi Shebeirach, that I say whenever I face a challenge, that I

339
00:31:04,510 --> 00:31:09,429
sing to my daughter thinking about her future when I tuck her into bed.

340
00:31:09,429 --> 00:31:15,429
It goes: "May the source of strength, who blessed the

341
00:31:15,429 --> 00:31:22,309
ones before us, help us *find the courage* to make our lives a blessing."

342
00:31:22,309 --> 00:31:29,780
I hope you find the courage to make your life a blessing.

343
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:31,720
Congratulations, Class of '17!

344
00:31:31,720 --> 00:32:18,220
Good luck out there.
