00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:08,880
Today I want to talk about three ways to create a world where everyone has a sense of purpose:

2
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:15,560
by taking on big meaningful projects together, by redefining equality so everyone has the

3
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:22,130
freedom to pursue purpose, and by building community across the world.

4
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:27,770
First, let's take on big meaningful projects.

5
00:00:27,770 --> 00:00:32,010
Our generation will have to deal with tens of millions of jobs replaced by automation

6
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:34,460
like self-driving cars and trucks.

7
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:38,380
But we have the potential to do so much more together.

8
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:41,160
Every generation has its defining works.

9
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:46,180
More than 300,000 people worked to put a man on the moon \'96 including that janitor.

10
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:49,970
Millions of volunteers immunized children around the world against polio.

11
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:52,811
Millions of more people built the Hoover dam and other great projects.

12
00:00:52,811 --> 00:00:53,920
These projects didn't just provide purpose for the people doing those jobs, they gave

13
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:54,920
our whole country a sense of pride that we could do great things.

14
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:58,320
Now it's our turn to do great things.

15
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:04,020
I know, you're probably thinking: I don't know how to build a dam, or get a million

16
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:06,360
people involved in anything.

17
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:13,880
But let me tell you a secret: no one does when they begin.

18
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:16,870
Ideas don't come out fully formed.

19
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:20,060
They only become clear as you work on them.

20
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:23,590
You just have to get started.

21
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:29,250
If I had to understand everything about connecting people before I began, I never would have

22
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:31,050
started Facebook.

23
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:34,290
Movies and pop culture get this all wrong.

24
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:39,110
The idea of a single eureka moment is a dangerous lie.

25
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:43,610
It makes us feel inadequate since we haven't had ours.

26
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:49,200
It prevents people with seeds of good ideas from getting started.

27
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,820
Oh, you know what else movies get wrong about innovation?

28
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:58,980
No one writes math formulas on glass.

29
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:03,380
That's not a thing.

30
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:08,820
It's good to be idealistic.

31
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:13,480
But be prepared to be misunderstood.

32
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:19,040
Anyone working on a big vision will get called crazy, even if you end up right.

33
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:24,240
Anyone working on a complex problem will get blamed for not fully understanding the challenge,

34
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:27,270
even though it's impossible to know everything upfront.

35
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:33,200
Anyone taking initiative will get criticized for moving too fast, because there's always

36
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,070
someone who wants to slow you down.

37
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:43,110
In our society, we often don't do big things because we're so afraid of making mistakes

38
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:48,040
that we ignore all the things wrong today if we do nothing.

39
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:54,410
The reality is, anything we do will have issues in the future.

40
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:59,620
But that can't keep us from starting.

41
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:01,440
So what are we waiting for?

42
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:06,070
It's time for our generation-defining public works.

43
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:10,420
How about stopping climate change before we destroy the planet and getting millions of

44
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:17,180
people involved manufacturing and installing solar panels?

45
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:23,940
How about curing all diseases and asking volunteers to track their health data and share their

46
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:25,630
genomes?

47
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:34,030
Today we spend 50x more treating people who are sick than we spend finding cures so people

48
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:35,450
don't get sick in the first place.

49
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:38,400
That makes no sense.

50
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,460
We can fix this.

51
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:51,000
How about modernizing democracy so everyone can vote online, and personalizing education

52
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,700
so everyone can learn?

53
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:58,220
These achievements are within our reach.

54
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:03,630
Let's do them all in a way that gives everyone in our society a role.

55
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:16,280
Let's do big things, not only to create progress, but to create purpose.

56
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:21,250
So taking on big meaningful projects is the first thing we can do to create a world where

57
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:23,900
everyone has a sense of purpose.

58
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:34,260
The second is redefining equality to give everyone the freedom they need to pursue purpose.

59
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:37,470
Many of our parents had stable jobs throughout their careers.

60
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:43,700
Now we're all entrepreneurial, whether we're starting projects or finding or role.

61
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,410
And that's great.

62
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:50,100
Our culture of entrepreneurship is how we create so much progress.

63
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:57,840
Now, an entrepreneurial culture thrives when it's easy to try lots of new ideas.

64
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,230
Facebook wasn't the first thing I built.

65
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:04,550
I also built games, chat systems, study tools and music players.

66
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:05,740
I'm not alone.

67
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:12,880
JK Rowling got rejected 12 times before publishing Harry Potter.

68
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:21,500
Even Beyonce had to make hundreds of songs to get Halo.

69
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:27,660
The greatest successes come from having the freedom to fail.

70
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:38,590
But today, we have a level of wealth inequality that hurts everyone.

71
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:45,320
When you don't have the freedom to take your idea and turn it into a historic enterprise,

72
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,850
we all lose.

73
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:54,600
Right now our society is way over-indexed on rewarding success and we don't do nearly

74
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:59,360
enough to make it easy for everyone to take lots of shots.

75
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,900
Let's face it.

76
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:06,590
There is something wrong with our system when I can leave here and make billions of dollars

77
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:12,170
in 10 years while millions of students can't afford to pay off their loans, let alone start

78
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:16,850
a business.

79
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:26,690
Look, I know a lot of entrepreneurs, and I don't know a single person who gave up on

80
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:31,310
starting a business because they might not make enough money.

81
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:36,690
But I know lots of people who haven't pursued dreams because they didn't have a cushion

82
00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:44,820
to fall back on if they failed.

83
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:49,350
We all know we don't succeed just by having a good idea or working hard.

84
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:53,440
We succeed by being lucky too.

85
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:59,519
If I had to support my family growing up instead of having time to code, if I didn't know I'd

86
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:05,269
be fine if Facebook didn't work out, I wouldn't be standing here today.

87
00:07:05,269 --> 00:07:13,250
If we're honest, we all know how much luck we've had.

88
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:18,650
Every generation expands its definition of equality.

89
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:22,630
Previous generations fought for the vote and civil rights.

90
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:26,660
They had the New Deal and Great Society.

91
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:37,840
Now it's our time to define a new social contract for our generation.

92
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:44,370
We should have a society that measures progress not just by economic metrics like GDP, but

93
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:48,070
by how many of us have a role we find meaningful.

94
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:53,560
We should explore ideas like universal basic income to give everyone a cushion to try new

95
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,950
things.

96
00:07:55,950 --> 00:08:02,250
We\'92re going to change jobs many times, so we need affordable childcare to get to

97
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:10,200
work and healthcare that aren't tied to one company.

98
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:14,880
We're all going to make mistakes, so we need a society that focuses less on locking us

99
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:18,470
up or stigmatizing us.

100
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:25,320
And as technology keeps changing, we need to focus more on continuous education throughout

101
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:34,300
our lives.\ And yes, giving everyone the freedom to pursue

102
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:37,580
purpose isn't free.

103
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:39,380
People like me should pay for it.

104
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:46,940
Many of you will do well and you should too.

105
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:56,340
That's why Priscilla and I started the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative and committed our wealth

106
00:08:56,340 --> 00:09:01,100
to promoting equal opportunity.

107
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:07,390
These are the values of our generation.

108
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:11,720
It was never a question of if we were going to do this.

109
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:14,750
The only question was when.

110
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:19,450
Millennials are already one of the most charitable generations in history.

111
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:26,660
In one year, three of four US millennials made a donation and seven out of ten raised

112
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:29,140
money for charity.

113
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:32,290
But it's not just about money.

114
00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:34,650
You can also give time.

115
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:40,150
I promise you, if you take an hour or two a week -- that's all it takes to give someone

116
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:42,480
a hand, to help them reach their potential.

117
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:48,760
Maybe you think that's too much time.

118
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:51,420
I used to.

119
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:56,290
When Priscilla graduated from Harvard she became a teacher, and before she'd do education

120
00:09:56,290 --> 00:10:02,150
work with me, she told me I needed to teach a class.

121
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:05,960
I complained: "Well, I'm kind of busy.

122
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:09,070
I'm running this company."

123
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:15,940
But she insisted, so I taught a middle school program on entrepreneurship at the local Boys

124
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:20,570
and Girls Club.

125
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:26,130
I taught them lessons on product development and marketing, and they taught me what it's

126
00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:34,540
like feeling targeted for your race and having a family member in prison.

127
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:41,940
I shared stories from my time in school, and they shared their hope of one day going to

128
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:44,810
college too.

129
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:51,660
For five years now, I\'92ve been having dinner with those kids every month.

130
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:55,890
One of them threw me and Priscilla our first baby shower.

131
00:10:55,890 --> 00:10:58,610
And next year they\'92re going to college.

132
00:10:58,610 --> 00:11:03,800
Every one of them.

133
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:07,140
First in their families.

134
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:11,020
We can all make time to give someone a hand.

135
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:15,020
Let's give everyone the freedom to pursue their purpose -- not only because it's the

136
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:19,280
right thing to do, but because when more people can turn their dreams into something great,

137
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:30,169
we're all better for it.
