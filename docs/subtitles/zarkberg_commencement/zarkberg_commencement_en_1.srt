00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:40,430
President Faust, Board of Overseers, faculty, alumni, friends, proud parents, members of

3
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:55,360
the ad board, and graduates of the greatest university in the world,

4
00:00:55,360 --> 00:01:00,660
I'm honored to be with you today because, let's face it, you accomplished something

5
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:04,190
I never could.

6
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:09,830
If I get through this speech, it'll be the first time I actually finish something at

7
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:11,260
Harvard.

8
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:16,570
Class of 2017, congratulations!

9
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:26,650
I'm an unlikely speaker, not just because I dropped out, but because we're technically

10
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:29,400
in the same generation.

11
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:35,010
We walked this yard less than a decade apart, studied the same ideas and slept through the

12
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:37,870
same Ec10 lectures.

13
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:43,150
We may have taken different paths to get here, especially if you came all the way from the

14
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:49,810
Quad, but today I want to share what I've learned about our generation and the world

15
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:51,830
we're building together.

16
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:57,500
But first, the last couple of days have brought back a lot of good memories.

17
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:03,600
How many of you remember exactly what you were doing when you got that email telling

18
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:13,140
you that you got into Harvard?

19
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:20,640
I was playing Civilization and I ran downstairs, got my dad, and for some reason, his reaction

20
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,650
was to video me opening the email.

21
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:28,310
That could have been a really sad video.

22
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:36,569
I swear getting into Harvard is still the thing my parents are most proud of me for.

23
00:02:36,569 --> 00:02:52,000
What about  your first lecture at Harvard?

24
00:02:52,000 --> 00:03:00,689
Mine was Computer Science 121 with the incredible Harry Lewis.

25
00:03:00,689 --> 00:03:07,389
I was late so I threw on a t-shirt and didn't realize until afterwards it was inside out

26
00:03:07,389 --> 00:03:10,609
and backwards with my tag sticking out the front.

27
00:03:10,609 --> 00:03:19,120
I couldn't figure out why no one would talk to me -- except one guy, KX Jin, he just went

28
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,180
with it.

29
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:25,290
We ended up doing our problem sets together, and now he runs a big part of Facebook.

30
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:34,669
And that, Class of 2017, is why you should be nice to people.

31
00:03:34,669 --> 00:03:44,159
But my best memory from Harvard was meeting Priscilla.

32
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:55,200
I had just launched this prank website Facemash, and the ad board wanted to "see me".

33
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,349
Everyone thought I was going to get kicked out.

34
00:03:57,349 --> 00:04:01,189
My parents came to help me pack.

35
00:04:01,189 --> 00:04:07,010
My friends threw me a going away party.

36
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:12,099
As luck would have it, Priscilla was at that party with her friend.

37
00:04:12,099 --> 00:04:16,960
We met in line for the bathroom in the Pfoho Belltower, and in what must be one of the

38
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:23,060
all time romantic lines, I said: "I'm going to get kicked out in three days, so we need

39
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:24,100
to go on a date quickly."

40
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:32,580
Actually, any of you graduating can use that line.

41
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:41,770
I didn't end up getting kicked out -- I did that to myself.

42
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:43,380
Priscilla and I started dating.

43
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:49,930
And, you know, that movie made it seem like Facemash was so important to creating Facebook.

44
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:51,590
It wasn't.

45
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:57,680
But without Facemash I wouldn't have met Priscilla, and she's the most important person in my

46
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:08,400
life, so you could say it was the most important thing I built in my time here.

47
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:20,199
We've all started lifelong friendships here, and some of us even families.

48
00:05:20,199 --> 00:05:24,540
That's why I'm so grateful to this place.

49
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:30,490
Thanks, Harvard.

50
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:34,970
Today I want to talk about purpose.
