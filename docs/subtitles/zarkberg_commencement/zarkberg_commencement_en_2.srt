1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,710
But I'm not here to give you the standard commencement about finding your purpose.

2
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:06,280
We're millennials.

3
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:08,860
We'll try to do that instinctively.

4
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:16,259
Instead, I'm here to tell you finding your purpose isn't enough.

5
00:00:16,259 --> 00:00:23,110
The challenge for our generation is creating a world where everyone has a sense of purpose.

6
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:30,710
One of my favorite stories is when John F Kennedy visited the NASA space center, he

7
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:33,900
saw a janitor carrying a broom and he walked over and asked what he was doing.

8
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:40,740
The janitor responded: "Mr. President, I'm helping put a man on the moon".

9
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:47,590
Purpose is that sense that we are part of something bigger than ourselves, that we are

10
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:52,199
needed, that we have something better ahead to work for.

11
00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:56,550
Purpose is what creates true happiness.

12
00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:59,860
You're graduating at a time when this is especially important.

13
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:09,030
When our parents graduated, purpose reliably came from your job, your church, your community.

14
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:14,599
But today, technology and automation are eliminating many jobs.

15
00:01:14,599 --> 00:01:17,090
Membership in communities is declining.

16
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:24,020
Many people feel disconnected and depressed, and are trying to fill a void.

17
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:29,469
As I've traveled around, I've sat with children in juvenile detention and opioid addicts,

18
00:01:29,469 --> 00:01:33,509
who told me their lives could have turned out differently if they just had something

19
00:01:33,509 --> 00:01:38,099
to do, an after school program or somewhere to go.

20
00:01:38,099 --> 00:01:41,939
I've met factory workers who know their old jobs aren't coming back and are trying to

21
00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:43,909
find their place.

22
00:01:43,909 --> 00:01:51,490
To keep our society moving forward, we have a generational challenge -- to not only create

23
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:56,779
new jobs, but create a renewed sense of purpose.

24
00:01:56,779 --> 00:02:07,020
I remember the night I launched Facebook from my little dorm in Kirkland House.

25
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:10,960
I went to Noch's with my friend KX.

26
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:16,900
I remember telling him I was excited to connect the Harvard community, but one day someone

27
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:19,650
would connect the whole world.

28
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:23,439
The thing is, it never even occurred to me that someone might be us.

29
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:24,949
We were just college kids.

30
00:02:24,949 --> 00:02:26,800
We didn't know anything about that.

31
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,410
There were all these big technology companies with resources.

32
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:33,229
I just assumed one of them would do it.

33
00:02:33,229 --> 00:02:38,330
But this idea was so clear to us -- that all people want to connect.

34
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:43,050
So we just kept moving forward, day by day.

35
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:47,320
I know a lot of you will have your own stories just like this.

36
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:54,190
A change in the world that seems so clear you're sure someone else will do it.

37
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:55,460
But they won't.

38
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:57,470
You will.

39
00:02:57,470 --> 00:03:00,939
But it's not enough to have purpose yourself.

40
00:03:00,939 --> 00:03:05,170
You have to create a sense of purpose for others.

41
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:07,230
I found that out the hard way.

42
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:13,630
You see, my hope was never to build a company, but to make an impact.

43
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:17,820
And as all these people started joining us, I just assumed that's what they cared about

44
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:23,480
too, so I never explained what I hoped we'd build.

45
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:27,540
A couple years in, some big companies wanted to buy us.

46
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,160
I didn't want to sell.

47
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:32,010
I wanted to see if we could connect more people.

48
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:37,201
We were building the first News Feed, and I thought if we could just launch this, it

49
00:03:37,201 --> 00:03:41,170
could change how we learn about the world.

50
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:44,870
Nearly everyone else wanted to sell.

51
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:49,420
Without a sense of higher purpose, this was the startup dream come true.

52
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:52,130
It tore our company apart.

53
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:59,320
After one tense argument, an advisor told me if I didn't agree to sell, I would regret

54
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:03,110
the decision for the rest of my life.

55
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:08,900
Relationships were so frayed that within a year or so every single person on the management

56
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:12,860
team was gone.

57
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:16,790
That was my hardest time leading Facebook.

58
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:20,390
I believed in what we were doing, but I felt alone.

59
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:23,670
And worse, it was my fault.

60
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:31,610
I wondered if I was just wrong, an imposter, a 22 year-old kid who had no idea how the

61
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:33,610
world worked.

62
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:40,000
Now, years later, I understand that *is* how things work with no sense of higher purpose.

63
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:46,850
It's up to us to create it so we can all keep moving forward together.
