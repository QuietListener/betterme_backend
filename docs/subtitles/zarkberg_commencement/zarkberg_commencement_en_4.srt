1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,590
Purpose doesn't only come from work.

2
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:11,250
The third way we can create a sense of purpose for everyone is by building community.

3
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:18,630
And when our generation says "everyone", we mean everyone in the world.

4
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:24,960
Quick show of hands: how many of you are from another country?

5
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:32,590
Now, how many of you are friends with one of these folks?

6
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:34,819
Now we're talking.

7
00:00:34,819 --> 00:00:40,910
We have grown up connected.\ In a survey asking millennials around the

8
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:48,640
world what defines our identity, the most popular answer wasn't nationality, religion

9
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,900
or ethnicity, it was "citizen of the world".

10
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:55,770
That's a big deal.

11
00:00:55,770 --> 00:01:00,640
Every generation expands the circle of people we consider "one of us".

12
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:07,280
For us, it now encompasses the entire world.

13
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:13,330
We understand the great arc of human history bends towards people coming together in ever

14
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:19,080
greater numbers -- from tribes to cities to nations -- to achieve things we couldn't on

15
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,940
our own.

16
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:25,430
We get that our greatest opportunities are now global -- we can be the generation that

17
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:29,580
ends poverty, that ends disease.

18
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:35,190
We get that our greatest challenges need global responses too -- no country can fight climate

19
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:39,000
change alone or prevent pandemics.

20
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:45,620
Progress now requires coming together not just as cities or nations, but also as a global

21
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:48,510
community.

22
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:51,990
But we live in an unstable time.

23
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:57,300
There are people left behind by globalization across the world.

24
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:02,100
It's hard to care about people in other places if we don't feel good about our lives here

25
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:04,680
at home.

26
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:07,950
There's pressure to turn inwards.

27
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:11,030
This is the struggle of our time.

28
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:17,770
The forces of freedom, openness and global community against the forces of authoritarianism,

29
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:20,910
isolationism and nationalism.

30
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:27,040
Forces for the flow of knowledge, trade and immigration against those who would slow them

31
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,530
down.

32
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:36,020
This is not a battle of nations, it's a battle of ideas.

33
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:43,050
There are people in every country for global connection and good people against it.

34
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:46,530
This isn't going to be decided at the UN either.

35
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:53,200
It's going to happen at the local level, when enough of us feel a sense of purpose and stability

36
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:58,290
in our own lives that we can open up and start caring about everyone.

37
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:16,260
The best way to do that is to start building local communities right now.

38
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:38,939
We all get meaning from our communities.

39
00:03:38,939 --> 00:03:44,430
Whether our communities are houses or sports teams, churches or music groups, they give

40
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:50,810
us that sense we are part of something bigger, that we are not alone; they give us the strength

41
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:54,130
to expand our horizons.

42
00:03:54,130 --> 00:04:01,530
That's why it's so striking that for decades, membership in all kinds of groups has declined

43
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:03,510
as much as one-quarter.

44
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:07,350
That's a lot of people who now need to find purpose somewhere else.

45
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:13,819
But I know we can rebuild our communities and start new ones because many of you already

46
00:04:13,819 --> 00:04:16,720
are.

47
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:21,569
I met Agnes Igoye, who's graduating today.

48
00:04:21,569 --> 00:04:26,520
Where are you, Agnes?

49
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:35,590
She spent her childhood navigating conflict zones in Uganda, and now she trains thousands

50
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:47,160
of law enforcement officers to keep communities safe.

51
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:52,740
I met Kayla Oakley and Niha Jain, graduating today, too.

52
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:54,780
Stand up.

53
00:04:54,780 --> 00:05:02,310
Kayla and Niha started a non-profit that connects people suffering from illnesses with people

54
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:15,450
in their communities willing to help.

55
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:18,210
I met David Razu Aznar, graduating from the Kennedy School today.

56
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:21,630
David, stand up.

57
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:29,780
He's a former city councilor who successfully led the battle to make Mexico City the first

58
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:41,880
Latin American city to pass marriage equality -- even before San Francisco.

59
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:44,540
This is my story too.

60
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:52,650
A student in a dorm room, connecting one community at a time, and keeping at it until one day

61
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:57,370
we connect the whole world.

62
00:05:57,370 --> 00:06:00,480
Change starts local.

63
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:05,380
Even global changes start small -- with people like us.

64
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:11,300
In our generation, the struggle of whether we connect more, whether we achieve our biggest

65
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:18,560
opportunities, comes down to this -- your ability to build communities and create a

66
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:33,340
world where every single person has a sense of purpose.

67
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:41,010
Class of 2017, you are graduating into a world that needs purpose.

68
00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:43,700
It's up to you to create it.

69
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:53,720
Now, you may be thinking: can I really do this?

70
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:58,689
Remember when I told you about that class I taught at the Boys and Girls Club?

71
00:06:58,689 --> 00:07:04,470
One day after class I was talking to them about college, and one of my top students

72
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:10,410
raised his hand and said he wasn't sure he could go because he's undocumented.

73
00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:14,230
He didn't know if they'd let him in.

74
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:18,370
Last year I took him out to breakfast for his birthday.

75
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:24,210
I wanted to get him a present, so I asked him and he started talking about students

76
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:33,780
he saw struggling and said "You know, I'd really just like a book on social justice."

77
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:36,050
I was blown away.

78
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:42,860
Here's a young guy who has every reason to be cynical.

79
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:50,450
He didn't know if the country he calls home -- the only one he's known -- would deny him

80
00:07:50,450 --> 00:07:54,650
his dream of going to college.

81
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:56,760
But he wasn't feeling sorry for himself.

82
00:07:56,760 --> 00:08:00,700
He wasn't even thinking of himself.

83
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:09,370
He has a greater sense of purpose, and he's going to bring people along with him.

84
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:13,971
It says something about our current situation that I can't even say his name because I don't

85
00:08:13,971 --> 00:08:18,080
want to put him at risk.

86
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:24,260
But if a high school senior who doesn't know what the future holds can do his part to move

87
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:57,300
the world forward, then we owe it to the world to do our part too.

88
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:05,970
Before you walk out those gates one last time, as we sit in front of Memorial Church, I am

89
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:15,520
reminded of a prayer, Mi Shebeirach, that I say whenever I face a challenge, that I

90
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:20,439
sing to my daughter thinking about her future when I tuck her into bed.

91
00:09:20,439 --> 00:09:26,439
It goes: "May the source of strength, who blessed the

92
00:09:26,439 --> 00:09:33,319
ones before us, help us *find the courage* to make our lives a blessing."

93
00:09:33,319 --> 00:09:40,790
I hope you find the courage to make your life a blessing.

94
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:42,730
Congratulations, Class of '17!

95
00:09:42,730 --> 00:10:29,230
Good luck out there.
