TED：How languages evolve 
语言是如何演变的

2
00:00:07,369 --> 00:00:09,722
In the biblical story of the Tower of Babel,
在圣经故事巴别塔中，

3
00:00:09,722 --> 00:00:12,566
all of humanity once spoke a single language
所有人类都讲同一种语言，

4
00:00:12,566 --> 00:00:14,818
until they suddenly split into many groups
直到他们突然分裂成多个

5
00:00:14,818 --> 00:00:16,973
unable to understand each other.
相互之间都听不懂的族群。

6
00:00:16,973 --> 00:00:20,526
We don't really know if such an original language ever existed,
我们不知道是否曾经存在过
这么一种初始语言，

7
00:00:20,526 --> 00:00:23,792
but we do know that the thousands of languages existing today
但我们知道如今的成千上万种语言

8
00:00:23,792 --> 00:00:27,021
can be traced back to a much smaller number.
可以追溯到有限的几种。

9
00:00:27,021 --> 00:00:29,245
So how did we end up with so many?
那么我们是如何最终形成这么多语言的呢？

10
00:00:29,245 --> 00:00:31,607
In the early days of human migration,
在早期人类迁徙的时候，

11
00:00:31,607 --> 00:00:33,652
the world was much less populated.
地球上人烟稀少。

12
00:00:33,652 --> 00:00:36,621
Groups of people that shared a single language and culture
拥有同一种语言文化的族群

13
00:00:36,621 --> 00:00:38,726
often split into smaller tribes,
通常分裂为更小的部落，

14
00:00:38,726 --> 00:00:42,166
going separate ways in search of fresh game and fertile land.
分头各自寻找野味和肥沃的土地。

15
00:00:42,166 --> 00:00:44,600
As they migrated and settled in new places,
当他们迁移定居在新的地方后，

16
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,611
they became isolated from one another
相互之间变得疏远

17
00:00:46,611 --> 00:00:48,652
and developed in different ways.
并以各自不同的方式发展。

18
00:00:48,652 --> 00:00:50,475
Centuries of living in different conditions,
几个世纪的不同生活条件，

19
00:00:50,475 --> 00:00:51,569
eating different food
不同食物，

20
00:00:51,569 --> 00:00:53,482
and encountering different neighbors
不同邻居，

21
00:00:53,482 --> 00:00:56,886
turned similar dialects with varied pronunciation and vocabulary
使原本相似而只是发音和词汇有所不同的方言

22
00:00:56,886 --> 00:00:59,197
into radically different languages,
变成了完全不同的语言，

23
00:00:59,197 --> 00:01:02,912
continuing to divide as populations grew and spread out further.
并随着人口的增长和迁移不断分化。

24
00:01:02,912 --> 00:01:06,597
Like genealogists, modern linguists try to map this process
系谱学家、现代语言学家等试图重现这个过程，

25
00:01:06,597 --> 00:01:09,705
by tracing multiple languages back as far as they can
他们尽力追溯不同语言的

26
00:01:09,705 --> 00:01:12,651
to their common ancestor, or protolanguage.
共同的起源，也称为原始母语。

27
00:01:12,651 --> 00:01:16,865
A group of all languages related in this way is called a language family,
以同一原始母语演化而来的不同语言称为一个语系，

28
00:01:16,865 --> 00:01:20,271
which can contain many branches and sub-families.
它可能包括很多分支和子系。

29
00:01:20,271 --> 00:01:24,416
So how do we determine whether languages are related in the first place?
那么我们如何确定不同语言
在开始的时候是有关联的呢？

30
00:01:24,416 --> 00:01:26,570
Similar sounding words don't tell us much.
相似的发音并不能说明什么。

31
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:29,862
They could be false cognates or just directly borrowed terms
它们可能是被误解的同源词
或者只是外来语

32
00:01:29,862 --> 00:01:32,382
rather than derived from a common root.
而不是源于同根。

33
00:01:32,382 --> 00:01:34,756
Grammar and syntax are a more reliable guide,
语法和句法有更可靠的指导意义，

34
00:01:34,756 --> 00:01:36,463
as well as basic vocabulary,
基本词汇也是，

35
00:01:36,463 --> 00:01:39,146
such as pronouns, numbers or kinship terms,
像代词、数字或亲属称谓，

36
00:01:39,146 --> 00:01:41,504
that's less likely to be borrowed.
这些都不太可能是外来语。

37
00:01:41,504 --> 00:01:43,790
By systematically comparing these features
通过系统地比较这些特征，

38
00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:46,346
and looking for regular patterns of sound changes
查找读音变化的常见形式

39
00:01:46,346 --> 00:01:48,556
and correspondences between languages,
和不同语言的对应关系，

40
00:01:48,556 --> 00:01:50,501
linguists can determine relationships,
语言学家能们够确定它们之间的关系，

41
00:01:50,501 --> 00:01:52,718
trace specific steps in their evolution
追溯它们发展演变的详细过程，

42
00:01:52,718 --> 00:01:56,723
and even reconstruct earlier languages with no written records.
甚至重建没有文字记录的早期语言。

43
00:01:56,723 --> 00:02:00,744
Linguistics can even reveal other important historical clues,
语言学家们甚至可以发现其他重要的历史线索，

44
00:02:00,744 --> 00:02:04,683
such as determining the geographic origins and lifestyles of ancient peoples
比如确定地理起源和古代人的生活方式，

45
00:02:04,683 --> 00:02:06,542
based on which of their words were native,
这是基于他们的语言哪些是母语，

46
00:02:06,542 --> 00:02:08,761
and which were borrowed.
哪些是外来语。

47
00:02:08,761 --> 00:02:10,724
There are two main problems linguists face
语言学家们在重建这些语言系谱时

48
00:02:10,724 --> 00:02:13,049
when constructing these language family trees.
主要面临两大问题。

49
00:02:13,049 --> 00:02:15,642
One is that there is no clear way of deciding
一个是没有清晰定义

50
00:02:15,642 --> 00:02:17,505
where the branches at the bottom should end, that is,
系谱树的枝干末端在哪里，

51
00:02:17,505 --> 00:02:22,755
which dialects should be considered separate languages or vice versa.
也就是说，哪种方言应该被认为是不同语言或只是方言。

52
00:02:22,755 --> 00:02:25,248
Chinese is classified as a single language,
汉语被归类为一门语言，

53
00:02:25,248 --> 00:02:29,052
but its dialects vary to the point of being mutually unintelligible,
但它的不同方言之间差别大到完全听不懂，

54
00:02:29,052 --> 00:02:31,017
while speakers of Spanish and Portuguese
然而讲西班牙语和葡萄牙语的人们

55
00:02:31,017 --> 00:02:32,885
can often understand each other.
通常可以听懂对方。

56
00:02:32,885 --> 00:02:35,626
Languages actually spoken by living people
正在被人类使用的语言

57
00:02:35,626 --> 00:02:38,041
do not exist in neatly divided categories,
不存在严格的种类划分，

58
00:02:38,041 --> 00:02:40,111
but tend to transition gradually,
而是逐渐过渡，

59
00:02:40,111 --> 00:02:42,621
crossing borders and classifications.
跨越界限和分类。

60
00:02:42,621 --> 00:02:44,900
Often the difference between
languages and dialects
通常语言和方言的不同之处

61
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:48,011
is a matter of changing political and national considerations,
在于多变的政治和国家格局，

62
00:02:48,011 --> 00:02:50,637
rather than any linguistic features.
而不是语言学特征。

63
00:02:50,637 --> 00:02:52,877
This is why the answer to, "How many languages are there?"
这就是为什么“这个世界上究竟有多少种语言”的答案

64
00:02:52,877 --> 00:02:56,026
can be anywhere between 3,000 and 8,000,
可能是3000-8000之间某个数，

65
00:02:56,026 --> 00:02:58,080
depending on who's counting.
它取决于谁来数。

66
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,784
The other problem is that the farther we move back in time
另一个问题是我们沿着系谱树回溯

67
00:03:00,784 --> 00:03:02,149
towards the top of the tree,
越接近树的顶端，

68
00:03:02,149 --> 00:03:05,445
the less evidence we have about the languages there.
关于语言的证据就越少。

69
00:03:05,445 --> 00:03:07,499
The current division of major language families
现在对主要语系的划分，

70
00:03:07,499 --> 00:03:10,675
represents the limit at which relationships can be established
在合理的可能性内，不同语言之间的关系

71
00:03:10,675 --> 00:03:12,615
with reasonable certainty,
仅限于这几种，

72
00:03:12,615 --> 00:03:14,194
meaning that languages of different families
就意味着不同语系的语言

73
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:17,359
are presumed not to be related on any level.
在任一层面上都没有交集。

74
00:03:17,359 --> 00:03:18,819
But this may change.
但这种情况可能会变。

75
00:03:18,819 --> 00:03:21,593
While many proposals for higher level relationships --
很多人推测存在更高层面的关系

76
00:03:21,593 --> 00:03:23,706
or super families -- are speculative,
也就是超级语系，

77
00:03:23,706 --> 00:03:25,436
some have been widely accepted
一些说法已经被广泛认同

78
00:03:25,436 --> 00:03:27,015
and others are being considered,
另一些还有争议，

79
00:03:27,015 --> 00:03:29,992
especially for native languages with small speaker populations
特别是对只有较少人使用的语言

80
00:03:29,992 --> 00:03:32,432
that have not been extensively studied.
还没有全面研究。

81
00:03:32,432 --> 00:03:35,293
We may never be able to determine how language came about,
我们也许永远不会知道语言从何而来，

82
00:03:35,293 --> 00:03:38,808
or whether all human languages did in fact have a common ancestor
也不知道人类语言是否真有共同的
原始母语

83
00:03:38,808 --> 00:03:41,426
scattered through the babel of migration.
并通过移民们散落于各处。

84
00:03:41,426 --> 00:03:44,158
But the next time you hear a foreign language, pay attention.
不过当你下一次听到一门外语的时候，留意一下。

85
00:03:44,158 --> 00:03:46,571
It may not be as foreign as you think.
它也许并没有你想象的那么不同。
