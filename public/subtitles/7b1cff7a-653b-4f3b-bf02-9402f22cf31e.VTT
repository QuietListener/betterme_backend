6
00:00:13,143 --> 00:00:15,209
Well, time travel is possible,
让我告诉你，穿越时空是有可能的。

7
00:00:15,209 --> 00:00:15,834

00:00:15,834 --> 00:00:17,663
it's already been done.
它已经被实现了。

9
00:00:17,663 --> 00:00:18,958
Meet Sergei Krikalev,

15
00:00:30,978 --> 00:00:32,133
During his stay in space,
当他在太空的时候，

16
00:00:32,133 --> 00:00:34,381
he time traveled into his own future
他时空穿越到自己的未来，

17
00:00:34,381 --> 00:00:37,504
by 0.02 seconds.

00:00:37,504 --> 00:00:40,459
Traveling at 17,500 miles an hour,
当时，他在太空时的行驶速度为每小时17500英里。

19
00:00:40,459 --> 00:00:41,713
he experienced an effect
他体验了一种

20
00:00:41,713 --> 00:00:43,480
known as time dilation,
名为"时间膨胀"的效应。

21
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:44,963
and one day the same effect
而且，終一天 这种效应

22
00:00:44,963 --> 00:00:46,568
might make significant time travel
将会让穿越时空之时间更持久

23
00:00:46,568 --> 00:00:48,596
to the future commonplace.
也变以家常便饭的事。

24
00:00:49,397 --> 00:00:51,242
To see why moving faster through space
如果想了解为什么加快在空间里的行驶速度

25
00:00:51,242 --> 00:00:52,877
affects passage of time,
会影响时间流逝的速度,

26
00:00:52,877 --> 00:00:55,032
we need to go back to the 1880s,
我们得回到1880年,

27
00:00:55,032 --> 00:00:56,324
when two American scientists,
当时 两个美国科学家

28
00:00:56,324 --> 00:00:58,461
Albert Michelson and Edward Morley,
阿尔伯特?迈克尔逊 和 爱德华?莫雷

29
00:00:58,461 --> 00:00:59,672
were trying to measure the effect
尝试衡量

30
00:00:59,672 --> 00:01:01,376
of the Earth's movement around the Sun
地球绕太阳

31
00:01:01,376 --> 00:01:03,165
on the speed of light.
对光速有什么影响。

32
00:01:03,165 --> 00:01:04,294
When a beam of light was moving
他们以为， 当一束光

33
00:01:04,294 --> 00:01:05,830
in the same direction as the Earth,
和地球往同一个方向移动时,

34
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:08,253
they expected the light to travel faster.
光的速度会更快。

35
00:01:08,253 --> 00:01:10,590
And when the Earth was moving in the opposite direction,
而且，当地球与光束作反方向移动时，

36
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:12,895
they expected it to go slower.
光的速度会减慢。

37
00:01:12,895 --> 00:01:14,880
But they found something very curious.
但是结果并非如此，有趣的是

38
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,200
The speed of light remained the same
不管地球往哪个方向移动

39
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,943
no matter what the Earth was doing.
光的速度并没有改变。

40
00:01:18,405 --> 00:01:20,542
Two decades later, Albert Einstein was thinking
20年之后，爱因斯坦回到

41
00:01:20,542 --> 00:01:21,784
about the consequences
这个问题的結果上：

42
00:01:21,784 --> 00:01:23,983
of that never-changing speed of light.
光速不变。

43
00:01:23,983 --> 00:01:25,345
And it was his conclusions,
他的结论是：

44
00:01:25,345 --> 00:01:27,946
formulated in the theory of special relativity,
他所創的“相对论”

45
00:01:27,946 --> 00:01:28,867
that opened the door
开启了

46
00:01:28,867 --> 00:01:30,788
into the world of time travel.
穿越时空的大门。

47
00:01:30,788 --> 00:01:32,539
Imagine a man named Jack,
试想 一個名為杰克的人

48
00:01:32,539 --> 00:01:34,090
standing in the middle of a train carriage,
站在一辆火车卡中間

49
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:35,758
traveling at a steady speed.
在稳定状态下移动，

50
00:01:35,758 --> 00:01:37,012
Jack's bored
杰克覺无聊

51
00:01:37,012 --> 00:01:38,987
and starts bouncing a ball up and down.
开始在地上上下拍球

52
00:01:38,987 --> 00:01:40,836
What would Jill, standing on the platform,
這个时候站在月台上的吉尔

53
00:01:40,836 --> 00:01:41,845
see through the window
会透过窗口所看到

54
00:01:41,845 --> 00:01:43,629
as the train whistles through.
是什么？

55
00:01:43,629 --> 00:01:45,340
Well, between Jack dropping the ball
在杰克扔下球

56
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:46,594
and catching it again,
和接著球之间

57
00:01:46,594 --> 00:01:47,762
Jill would have seen him move
吉尔会看到杰克

58
00:01:47,762 --> 00:01:49,677
slightly further down the track,
和火车一起向前移动，

59
00:01:49,677 --> 00:01:50,845
resulting in her seeing the ball
結果她看到的球

60
00:01:50,845 --> 00:01:53,034
follow a triangular path.
是以三角形的路线移动的。

61
00:01:53,034 --> 00:01:54,543
This means Jill sees the ball
意思是，吉尔看到的球

62
00:01:54,543 --> 00:01:55,904
travel further than Jack does
比杰克所看到的 移动得更远

63
00:01:55,904 --> 00:01:58,103
in the same time period.
在同一个时间段里。

64
00:01:58,103 --> 00:01:59,974
And because speed is distance divided by time,
因为速度等于距离除以时间，

65
00:01:59,974 --> 00:02:02,677
Jill actually sees the ball move faster.
事實上 吉尔所看到球比杰克所看到的移动得更快。

66
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:05,302
But what if Jack's bouncing ball
但是，如果我们把杰克的球

67
00:02:05,302 --> 00:02:06,684
is replaced with two mirrors
用两面镜子作代替

68
00:02:06,684 --> 00:02:08,852
which bounce a beam of light between them?
而在镜子之间有一束光來回反弹。

69
00:02:08,852 --> 00:02:11,109
Jack still sees the beam dropping down
杰克依然会看到光束反弹

70
00:02:11,109 --> 00:02:12,753
and Jill still sees the light beam
吉尔还是会看到该光束

71
00:02:12,753 --> 00:02:14,310
travel a longer distance,
移动得更远，

72
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:15,991
except this time Jack and Jill
例外的是，这次杰克和吉尔

73
00:02:15,991 --> 00:02:17,449
cannot disagree on the speed
却会对光的速度有分歧。

74
00:02:17,449 --> 00:02:18,366
because the speed of light
這是因为光的速度

75
00:02:18,366 --> 00:02:20,757
remains the same no matter what.
无论如何 還是 保留不变。

76
00:02:21,234 --> 00:02:22,656
And if the speed is the same
如果速度是一样的话，

77
00:02:22,656 --> 00:02:24,205
while the distance is different,
而距离却不一样，

78
00:02:24,205 --> 00:02:27,694
this means the time taken will be different as well.
那花的时间将也不一样。

79
00:02:27,694 --> 00:02:29,578
Thus, time must tick at different rates
所以 当人们对他人相对地移动时，

80
00:02:29,578 --> 00:02:31,633
for people moving relative to each other.
时间一定以不一样的速率流逝。

81
00:02:32,187 --> 00:02:34,499
Imagine that Jack and Jill have highly accurate watches
试想如果杰克和吉尔都有非常精确的手表。

82
00:02:34,499 --> 00:02:37,888
that they synchronize before Jack boarded the train.
他们在杰克上火车前校对好时间。

83
00:02:37,888 --> 00:02:40,112
During the experiment, Jack and Jill would each see
当这个实验中，杰克和吉尔会看到

84
00:02:40,112 --> 00:02:42,011
their own watch ticking normally.
自己的手表正常的走。

85
00:02:42,811 --> 00:02:44,774
But if they meet up again later
但是如果他们在实验结束后相遇

86
00:02:44,774 --> 00:02:46,161
to compare watches,
比对彼此手表时，

87
00:02:46,161 --> 00:02:48,351
less time would have elapsed on Jack's watch,
他们会发现杰克的手表会走慢一些，

88
00:02:48,351 --> 00:02:49,311
balancing the fact
因此解释了这事实：

89
00:02:49,311 --> 00:02:51,779
that Jill saw the light move further.
吉尔看到的光移动得更远。

90
00:02:52,394 --> 00:02:54,075
This idea may sound crazy,
这听上去很诡异，

91
00:02:54,075 --> 00:02:56,128
but like any good scientific theory,
但是，像任何一个完好的科学理论，

92
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:57,614
it can be tested.
它是可以被测试的。

93
00:02:57,614 --> 00:03:00,460
In the 1970s, scientists boarded a plane
在1970年左右，

94
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:02,545
with some super accurate atomic clocks
科学家们 校对了一些超级准确的原子钟

95
00:03:02,545 --> 00:03:03,499
that were synchronized
一起带到飞机上去，

96
00:03:03,499 --> 00:03:05,255
with some others left on the ground.
而数个原子钟则留在陆地上，

97
00:03:05,947 --> 00:03:07,750
After the plane had flown around the world,
当飞机环球飞行之后，

98
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:09,976
the clocks on board showed a different time
他们发现飞机上的原子钟

99
00:03:09,976 --> 00:03:12,066
from those left behind.
和地球上的原子钟上显示的时间是不一样的。

100
00:03:12,066 --> 00:03:14,046
Of course, at the speed of trains and planes,
当然，以火车与飞机的速度，

101
00:03:14,046 --> 00:03:16,055
the effect is minuscule.
对时间膨胀的影响是很微小的。

102
00:03:16,055 --> 00:03:16,990
But the faster you go,
但是行驶的速度越快，

103
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:18,582
the more time dilates.
时间的膨胀越多。

104
00:03:18,582 --> 00:03:21,176
For astronauts orbiting the Earth for 800 days,
如果宇航员们环绕地球800天，

105
00:03:21,176 --> 00:03:22,760
it starts to add up.
其影响就会明显。

106
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:25,567
But what affects humans also affects machines.
言而，影响人类的也会影响机器。

107
00:03:25,567 --> 00:03:27,742
Satellites of the global positioning system
GPS的卫星

108
00:03:27,742 --> 00:03:29,409
are also hurdling around the Earth
同時也环绕著地球行驶，

109
00:03:29,409 --> 00:03:30,916
at thousands of miles an hour.
且速度为每小时数千英里。

110
00:03:30,916 --> 00:03:34,121
So, time dilation kicks in here, too.
因此，时间在这情況也显见膨胀的。

111
00:03:34,121 --> 00:03:35,562
In fact, their speed causes
事實上，GPS卫星的行驶速度导致

112
00:03:35,562 --> 00:03:37,300
the atomic clocks on board
飞行著的原子钟

113
00:03:37,003 --> 00:03:38,445
to disagree with clocks on the ground
与地上的原子钟之間

114
00:03:38,445 --> 00:03:40,831
by seven millionths of a second daily.
产生每天7百万分之一秒之差。

115
00:03:40,831 --> 00:03:42,290
Left uncorrected,
如果再不做校对的话，

116
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:44,144
this would cause GPS to lose accuracy
这将会令GPS失去准确性

117
00:03:44,144 --> 00:03:46,575
by a few kilometers each day.
且产生每天几公里差異 。

118
00:03:47,589 --> 00:03:49,690
So, what does all this have to do with time travel
那么，这些和穿越时空

119
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:51,496
to the far, distant future?
和去遥远的未来有什么关系呢？

120
00:03:51,496 --> 00:03:52,993
Well, the faster you go,
当行驶的速度越快，

121
00:03:52,993 --> 00:03:55,162
the greater the effect of time dilation.
时间膨胀的效应越大。

122
00:03:55,162 --> 00:03:56,551
If you could travel really close
如果你行驶的速度真的能夠接近

123
00:03:56,551 --> 00:04:00,793
to the speed of light, say 99.9999%,
光速的話，比方说，百分之99.9999,

124
00:04:00,793 --> 00:04:02,161
on a round-trip through space
绕太空來回一圈，

125
00:04:02,161 --> 00:04:04,723
for what seemed to you like ten years,
对你来说可能像过了10年，

126
00:04:04,723 --> 00:04:06,149
you'd actually return to Earth
但是当你回到地球时，

127
00:04:06,149 --> 00:04:08,428
around the year 9000.
将会是9000那年左右。

128
00:04:08,428 --> 00:04:10,575
Who knows what you'd see when you returned?!?
到那时候，谁知道你回来后会看到什么？

129
00:04:10,575 --> 00:04:12,246
Humanity merged with machines,
人类与机器分不开，

130
00:04:12,246 --> 00:04:13,978
extinct due to climate change
灭绝原於全球暖化

131
00:04:13,978 --> 00:04:15,333
or asteroid impact,
或行星之間撞击，

132
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:18,170
or inhabiting a permanent colony on Mars.
又或是人类在火星定居了。

133
00:04:18,831 --> 00:04:19,430
But the trouble is,
但问题是，

134
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:20,953
getting heavy things like people,
要把像人一样那么重的东西，

135
00:04:20,953 --> 00:04:22,407
not to mention space ships,
莫说太空飞船了，

136
00:04:22,407 --> 00:04:24,042
up to such speeds requires
移动到达接近光速般，

137
00:04:24,042 --> 00:04:26,783
unimaginable amounts of energy.
是需要不能想象的巨大能量。

138
00:04:26,783 --> 00:04:29,370
It already takes enormous particle accelerators
龐大量的粒子加速器

139
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:30,917
like the Large Hadron Collider
如大型粒子对撞机

140
00:04:30,917 --> 00:04:33,246
to accelerate tiny subatomic particles
已被需要来把微小的亚原子粒子加速

141
00:04:33,246 --> 00:04:35,161
to close to light speed.
到达接近光速了。

142
00:04:35,161 --> 00:04:37,299
But one day, if we can develop the tools
但是终有一天，如果我们能够发明一些工具

143
00:04:37,299 --> 00:04:39,513
to accelerate ourselves to similar speeds,
可以让我们加速到如光速度般，

144
00:04:39,513 --> 00:04:41,348
then we may regularly send time travelers
到那时候，我们可能隨時可以把穿越时空者

145
00:04:41,348 --> 00:04:42,351
into the future,
送到遥远的未来，

146
00:04:42,351 --> 00:04:45,397
bringing with them tales of a long, forgotten past.
还有带著我们 古老，被遺忘的故事去。
