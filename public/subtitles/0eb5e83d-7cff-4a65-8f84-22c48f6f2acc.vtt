5
00:00:15,357 --> 00:00:18,508
but sometimes, cancer cuts the brake lines,

6
00:00:18,508 --> 00:00:20,675

12
00:00:30,758 --> 00:00:33,425
to control the speed at which cells divide.
缺乏调节细胞分裂速度能力的体现。

13
00:00:33,425 --> 00:00:35,147

00:00:56,334 --> 00:00:59,378
One of these genes is BRCA1,

38
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:37,376
If your DNA is damaged,

39
00:01:37,376 --> 00:01:40,010
BRCA1 keeps the cell from dividing
乳腺癌1号基因可以使细胞停止分裂

40
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:41,679
until the mutation is repaired.
直到变异被修复。

41
00:01:41,679 --> 00:01:44,842
You have two copies of the BRCA1 gene
在你身体的每个细胞内，

42
00:01:44,842 --> 00:01:46,303
in every cell of your body.

This redundancy is a good a thing

46
00:01:52,009 --> 00:01:55,976
because you only need one functioning BRCA1 gene in a cell

47
00:01:55,976 --> 00:02:01,400
to regulate the cell cycle.
就能控制细胞周期，

48
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,009
But it's important to note

49
00:02:03,009 --> 00:02:05,113
that while these copies have a similar function
尽管这两个副本有着类似的功能，

50
00:02:05,113 --> 00:02:07,281
they're not necessarily the same.
但它们并不是完全一模一样。

51
00:02:07,281 --> 00:02:09,282
In fact, there are hundreds of variations,

52
00:02:09,282 --> 00:02:11,591
or alleles, of BRCA1.
或者说，有成百种乳腺癌1号基因的等位基因。

54
00:02:15,289 --> 00:02:16,540
In other words,

with better regulating and repair mechanisms than others.

57
00:02:20,592 --> 00:02:25,468
And in some cases, mutations may render BRCA1 ineffective.
在某些情况下，变异可能导致乳腺癌1号基因失效。

58
00:02:25,468 --> 00:02:27,050
When this happens,
当这种情况发生，

59
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:30,138
cells with damaged DNA are allowed to divide.
带有被损坏遗传物质的细胞会不受控制，继续分裂。

60
00:02:30,138 --> 00:02:31,425
As they divide,
随着它们的分裂，

61
00:02:31,425 --> 00:02:34,174
these cells may accumulate additional mutations.

62
00:02:34,174 --> 00:02:35,809
These mutations may cause the cell
这些变异可能导致细胞

63
00:02:35,809 --> 00:02:37,478
to become less specialized

64
00:02:37,478 --> 00:02:40,758
and stop performing its original function in the tissue.

65
00:02:40,758 --> 00:02:43,066
If this occurs, then there's a greater chance

66
00:02:43,066 --> 00:02:45,758
they'll develop into cancer cells.

67
00:02:45,758 --> 00:02:49,614
While we all have the gene, such as BRCA1, that can cause cancer,
我们每个人身体里都有诸如乳腺癌1号基因
这类可能导致癌症的基因存在，

68
00:02:49,614 --> 00:02:52,325
it's only when these genes fail at their function
但癌症只会发生在

69
00:02:52,325 --> 00:02:54,175
that problems develop.
这些基因失效时。

70
00:02:54,175 --> 00:02:57,207
Having an ineffective or mutated version of BRCA1

71
00:02:57,207 --> 00:02:59,679
can increase your susceptibility to cancer,

72
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:01,795
much like driving with bad brakes

73
00:03:01,795 --> 00:03:03,629
increases the risk of an accident.
更容易发生事故一样。
