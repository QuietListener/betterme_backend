TED:如何把自己变成化石
How to fossilize...yourself

2
00:00:06,975 --> 00:00:09,476
Imagine being a fossil:
想象自己若成为化石：

3
00:00:09,476 --> 00:00:11,799
touring the world's great museums,
在世界各大博物馆之间游走，

4
00:00:11,799 --> 00:00:14,941
inspiring awe in onlookers of all ages,
使各年龄层的游客们都心怀敬畏，

5
00:00:14,941 --> 00:00:18,313
posing for hordes of fawning photographers.
在大批殷勤的摄影师面前摆造型。

6
00:00:18,313 --> 00:00:20,345
Sound like something you'd like?
听起来觉得还不错？

7
00:00:20,345 --> 00:00:22,003
Well, good luck!
那么，祝你好运！

8
00:00:22,003 --> 00:00:25,876
At least 99.9% of creatures that have ever lived
至少99.9%曾经存在过的生物

9
00:00:25,876 --> 00:00:28,513
aren't preserved in the fossil record.
没能成为化石。

10
00:00:28,513 --> 00:00:29,865
But forget about them,
不过不用管它们，

11
00:00:29,865 --> 00:00:30,848
everyone else will,
因为剩下的都会成为化石，

12
00:00:30,848 --> 00:00:32,561
and listen up!
仔细挺好！

13
00:00:32,561 --> 00:00:33,718
If you want your corpse
如果你想要你的遗骨

14
00:00:33,718 --> 00:00:37,413
in the exclusive 0.01% Club,
成为那0.01%，

15
00:00:37,413 --> 00:00:40,063
the Hall of Preserved Fossil Fame,
进入名人化石保存室，

16
00:00:40,063 --> 00:00:42,825
it will not be easy.
并不容易。

17
00:00:42,825 --> 00:00:45,481
You better work!
你最好努力！

18
00:00:45,481 --> 00:00:47,916
Step one: die.
第一步：死亡。

19
00:00:47,916 --> 00:00:51,116
It's a cold, hard fact of fossilization.
成为化石的过程是冰冷无情的。

20
00:00:51,116 --> 00:00:53,148
Everything paleontologists find
古生物学家发现的一切

21
00:00:53,148 --> 00:00:56,814
was once alive and, at some point, died.
都是曾经活过，并且最终死掉的。

22
00:00:56,814 --> 00:00:58,289
We'll skip the details
我们把细节跳过

23
00:00:58,289 --> 00:01:02,125
and assume you had a long, fulfilling life
假设你拥有长久而幸福的一生

24
00:01:02,125 --> 00:01:04,917
so we can get to what is really important --
然后再来看看最关键的部分——

25
00:01:04,917 --> 00:01:07,130
how you die.
你怎么死的。

26
00:01:08,145 --> 00:01:10,336
There are many ways to become a fossil,
变成化石的方式有很多，

27
00:01:10,336 --> 00:01:13,714
so let's highlight your top death options.
我们着重聊聊那些高端一些的死法。

28
00:01:14,621 --> 00:01:17,018
You could get yourself trapped in tree sap,
你可以将自己裹在树的汁液中，

29
00:01:17,018 --> 00:01:19,129
which, when hardens, turns into amber
汁液会凝固变成琥珀

30
00:01:19,129 --> 00:01:22,304
and can survive intact for millions of years.
可以完好无损的保存几百万年。

31
00:01:22,304 --> 00:01:26,658
But unless you find a really big tree to sit under,
但除非你找到一棵足够大的树，

32
00:01:26,658 --> 00:01:28,636
amber preservation will likely remain
不然琥珀很可能只会保存

33
00:01:28,636 --> 00:01:32,777
the domain of insects and other very small animals.
昆虫和其他很小很小的动物尸体。

34
00:01:32,777 --> 00:01:34,914
Generally, the right place to be
如果你想成为化石，

35
00:01:34,914 --> 00:01:36,552
if you want to end up a fossil
一般来讲，最好的地方是

36
00:01:36,552 --> 00:01:39,570
is wherever sediment is actively being deposited,
沉积物容易保存的地方，

37
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:41,970
like a lake or an ocean floor.
像湖底或海底。

38
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:43,755
A mountaintop or prairie?
山顶或大草原？

39
00:01:43,755 --> 00:01:45,219
Not good!
不靠谱！

40
00:01:45,219 --> 00:01:46,510
You need to get buried,
你要被埋起来，

41
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:47,718
the faster the better,
埋的越快越好，

42
00:01:47,718 --> 00:01:50,221
because the longer you hang around on the surface,
因为你暴露在外的时间越久，

43
00:01:50,221 --> 00:01:51,720
the more likely you'll get eaten,
就越可能被吃掉，

44
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:52,550
scavenged,
被捡走，

45
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:54,054
or otherwise destroyed
或者被破坏

46
00:01:54,054 --> 00:01:56,930
before ever having a chance to get preserved.
在能够得到机会长久保存之前

47
00:01:56,930 --> 00:01:58,719
If you can get buried someplace
如果你被埋在一个地方

48
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:00,465
with little to no oxygen,

49
00:02:00,465 --> 00:02:02,909
like a bog or a deep lake bottom,
像泥塘或者深湖底，

50
00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:03,971
even better.
那就更好了。

51
00:02:03,971 --> 00:02:06,552
That lack of oxygen will slow down your decay
缺氧会减缓你尸体的腐烂

52
00:02:06,552 --> 00:02:09,446
and give you more time to fossilize.
给你更多时间变成化石。

53
00:02:09,446 --> 00:02:11,658
So, let's say you're lucky enough to die
那么，假设你幸运地

54
00:02:11,658 --> 00:02:13,652
and get buried in a shallow sea

55
00:02:13,652 --> 00:02:15,972
under muddy, sandy sediments.

56
00:02:15,972 --> 00:02:18,080
What's your next move?
下一步干吗呢？

57
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,300
One option is a process
一种选择是经历

58
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:21,246
called permineralization.

59
00:02:21,246 --> 00:02:23,388
While all your soft parts decay away,
伴随着你身上柔软的部分都慢慢腐烂，

60
00:02:23,388 --> 00:02:27,327
your bones get saturated with mineral-rich waters.
你的骨骼充满富含矿物质的海水。

61
00:02:27,327 --> 00:02:30,752
Bit by bit, microscopic crystals precipitate

64
00:02:35,829 --> 00:02:37,500
Otherwise, you'd better hope

65
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:38,664
the sediments around you harden
在你骨骼渐逝时，

66
00:02:38,664 --> 00:02:40,599
while your bones decay away
你周边的沉积物硬化

67
00:02:40,599 --> 00:02:43,134
and another sediment or mineral fills in the spaces

68
00:02:43,134 --> 00:02:44,723
your bones leave behind,
你骨骼留下的空间，

69
00:02:44,723 --> 00:02:48,694
creating a perfect cast of your skeleton.
铸造成完美的骨骼造型。

70
00:02:48,694 --> 00:02:51,320
Over time, the sediments around your fossil

71
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:54,479
will lithify or turn into rock.

to those sedimentary rocks

75
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:00,826
that might destroy your chances
并且可能导致后人

76
00:03:00,826 --> 00:03:02,733
of getting discovered.
没办法发现你身体变成的化石

77
00:03:02,733 --> 00:03:04,923
They could get uplifted into a mountain range
他们可能因为地壳上升成为山脉

78
00:03:04,923 --> 00:03:06,422
and eroded away
又被侵蚀流失

79
00:03:06,422 --> 00:03:08,428
or carried along in an oceanic plate

80
00:03:08,428 --> 00:03:11,530
and subducted back into the Earth's mantle,

81
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:14,842
melting your fossil into hot mush.

87
00:03:24,317 --> 00:03:25,438
close to the surface,
接近地表，

88
00:03:25,438 --> 00:03:26,971
but not so close

98
00:03:52,385 --> 00:03:54,097
