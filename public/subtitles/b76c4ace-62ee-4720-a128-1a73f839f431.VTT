TED:宇宙的灭亡
The death of the universe

2
00:00:06,494 --> 00:00:07,890
Looking up at the night sky,
仰望夜空，

3
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:10,910
we are amazed by how it seems to go on forever.
我们为其永无止境的广阔而感到惊讶。

4
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:12,395
But what will the sky look like
然而数十亿年前的天空

5
00:00:12,395 --> 00:00:13,865
billions of years from now?
又会是什么样子的呢 ？

6
00:00:13,865 --> 00:00:15,372
A particular type of scientist,
有一种科学家，

7
00:00:15,372 --> 00:00:16,616
called a cosmologist,
被称为宇宙学家，

8
00:00:16,616 --> 00:00:19,531
spends her time thinking about that very question.
她们就专门思考这样的问题。

9
00:00:19,531 --> 00:00:21,924
The end of the universe is intimately linked
宇宙的尽头

10
00:00:21,924 --> 00:00:23,868
to what the universe contains.
与其自身的构成有着密切的联系。

11
00:00:23,868 --> 00:00:25,170
Over 100 years ago,
一百多年前，

12
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:27,879
Einstein developed the Theory of General Relativity,
爱因斯坦提出了广义相对论，

13
00:00:27,879 --> 00:00:29,923
formed of equations that help us
帮助我们以方程的形式

14
00:00:29,923 --> 00:00:31,258
understand the relationship
来理解

15
00:00:31,258 --> 00:00:33,462
between what a universe is made of
宇宙的组成

16
00:00:33,462 --> 00:00:34,511
and its shape.
和其形状之间的关系。

17
00:00:34,511 --> 00:00:36,124
It turns out that the universe
结果表明

18
00:00:36,124 --> 00:00:38,178
could be curved like a ball or sphere.
宇宙可能是呈球状或半球状的曲线。

19
00:00:38,178 --> 00:00:40,676
We call this positively curved or closed.
我们称之为正弯曲或正关闭。

20
00:00:40,676 --> 00:00:42,228
Or it could be shaped like a saddle.
或者它也可能呈马鞍形。

21
00:00:42,228 --> 00:00:44,488
We call this negatively curved or open.
我们称之为负弯曲或负开放。

22
00:00:44,488 --> 00:00:46,033
Or it could be flat.
又或者它也可能是扁平状。

23
00:00:46,033 --> 00:00:47,155
And that shape determines
这样不同的形状决定着

24
00:00:47,155 --> 00:00:49,537
how the universe will live and die.
宇宙将会怎样存在和灭亡。

25
00:00:49,537 --> 00:00:52,632
We now know that the universe is very close to flat.
如今我们认为宇宙最接近扁平状。

26
00:00:52,632 --> 00:00:54,338
However, the components of the universe
然而组成宇宙的各个部分

27
00:00:54,338 --> 00:00:56,454
can still affect its eventual fate.
同时也会影响其最终的命运。

28
00:00:56,454 --> 00:00:58,033
We can predict how the universe
我们能够预测宇宙如何

29
00:00:58,033 --> 00:00:59,611
will change with time
随着时间而发生改变，

30
00:00:59,611 --> 00:01:01,793
if we measure the amounts or energy densities
这需要我们对目前组成宇宙的

31
00:01:01,793 --> 00:01:04,588
of the various components in the universe today.
各要素的数量及其能量密度进行测量。

32
00:01:04,588 --> 00:01:06,727
So, what is the universe made of?
那么，宇宙是由什么构成的呢？

33
00:01:06,727 --> 00:01:09,393
The universe contains all the things that we can see,
宇宙中包含着我们肉眼所能看到的一切，

34
00:01:09,393 --> 00:01:11,564
like stars, gas, and planets.
比如恒星、气体和行星。

35
00:01:11,564 --> 00:01:14,733
We call these things ordinary or baryonic matter.
我们称这些为普通物质或重子物质。

36
00:01:14,733 --> 00:01:16,593
Even though we see them all around us,
尽管它们就在我们的周围，

37
00:01:16,593 --> 00:01:18,702
the total energy density of these components
但这些组成部分的总能量密度

38
00:01:18,702 --> 00:01:20,440
is actually very small,
却十分渺小，

39
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:23,530
around 5% of the total energy of the universe.
它们仅占整个宇宙总能量的5%左右。

40
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:26,675
So, now let's talk about what the other 95% is.
那么现在我们就来探讨组成宇宙另外95%的部分是什么。

41
00:01:26,675 --> 00:01:29,081
Just under 27% of the rest
其他近27%的

42
00:01:29,081 --> 00:01:30,913
of the energy density of the universe
宇宙能量密度

43
00:01:30,913 --> 00:01:33,825
is made up of what we call dark matter.
是由暗物质构成的。

44
00:01:33,825 --> 00:01:36,928
Dark matter is only very weakly interacting with light,
暗物质与光的相互作用很弱，

45
00:01:36,928 --> 00:01:39,208
which means it doesn't shine or reflect light
也就是说暗物质本身并不发射或反射光线，

46
00:01:39,208 --> 00:01:41,191
in the way that stars and planets do,
这与其他恒星和恒星不同，

47
00:01:41,191 --> 00:01:42,288
but, in every other way,
但从其它方面来讲，

48
00:01:42,288 --> 00:01:44,259
it behaves like ordinary matter --
暗物质与普通物质是相似的—

49
00:01:44,259 --> 00:01:46,128
it attracts things gravitationally.
暗物质通过重力吸引物体。

50
00:01:46,128 --> 00:01:48,761
In fact, the only way we can detect this dark matter
事实上，我们唯一能够探测暗物质的方法

51
00:01:48,761 --> 00:01:51,052
is through this gravitational interaction,
就是通过暗物质与其它物质的重力相互作用，

52
00:01:51,052 --> 00:01:52,343
how things orbit around it
比如物体如何围绕暗物质运行

53
00:01:52,343 --> 00:01:53,595
and how it bends light
或暗物质如何扭曲光线

54
00:01:53,595 --> 00:01:56,008
as it curves the space around it.
使其周围空间呈显曲线状。

55
00:01:56,008 --> 00:01:58,343
We have yet to discover a dark matter particle,
目前我们还没能发现一块暗物质颗粒，

56
00:01:58,343 --> 00:02:00,815
but scientists all over the world are searching
但全世界的科学家们都在探索

57
00:02:00,815 --> 00:02:02,950
for this elusive particle or particles
这个或这些神秘的物质

58
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:05,843
and the effects of dark matter on the universe.
以及它对宇宙所产生的影响。

59
00:02:05,843 --> 00:02:08,256
But this still doesn't add up to 100%.
可是这样的组成结构还是未能达到100%。

60
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:09,784
The remaining 68%
剩余68%的

61
00:02:09,784 --> 00:02:11,680
of the energy density of the universe
宇宙能量密度

62
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,759
is made up of dark energy,
来自于暗能量，

63
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:16,457
which is even more mysterious than dark matter.
这种物质比暗物质更加神秘。

64
00:02:16,457 --> 00:02:18,422
This dark energy doesn't behave
这种暗能量的性质

65
00:02:18,422 --> 00:02:20,590
like any other substance we know at all
与我们所熟知的其他物质完全不同

66
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:23,013
and acts more like anti-gravity force.
它更像是反重力。

67
00:02:23,013 --> 00:02:25,420
We say that it has a gravitational pressure,
暗能量具有一种重力压力，

68
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:28,330
which ordinary matter and dark matter do not.
这是普通物质和暗物质所不具有的。

69
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:30,213
Instead of pulling the universe together,
宇宙并没有因为重力而向一起聚集，

70
00:02:30,213 --> 00:02:32,004
as we would expect gravity to do,
这与我们所预想的不同，

71
00:02:32,004 --> 00:02:34,287
the universe appears to be expanding apart
相反宇宙却似乎是在不断膨胀，

72
00:02:34,287 --> 00:02:36,110
at an ever-increasing rate.
并且这种膨胀还处于一种持续增长的速度。

73
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:37,938
The leading idea for dark energy
有关暗能量的主导观点认为

74
00:02:37,938 --> 00:02:40,148
is that it is a cosmological constant.
它是一个宇宙常量。

75
00:02:40,148 --> 00:02:42,245
That means it has the strange property
那意味着暗能量具有一种特殊属性，

76
00:02:42,245 --> 00:02:45,434
that it expands as the volume of space increases
它能够使暗能量随着宇宙体积的增长而扩大，

77
00:02:45,434 --> 00:02:47,606
to keep its energy density constant.
从而使其能量密度保持不变。

78
00:02:47,606 --> 00:02:49,441
So, as the universe expands
因此，随着宇宙不断膨胀，

79
00:02:49,441 --> 00:02:50,772
as it is doing right now,
正如此时此刻，

80
00:02:50,772 --> 00:02:52,742
there will be more and more dark energy.
暗能量也会随之不断增长。

81
00:02:52,742 --> 00:02:54,574
Dark matter and baryonic matter,
然而暗物质和重子物质，

82
00:02:54,574 --> 00:02:55,277
on the other hand,
从另一方面来看，

83
00:02:55,277 --> 00:02:56,622
don't expand with the universe
则不会随宇宙而增长

84
00:02:56,622 --> 00:02:58,409
and become more diluted.
反而他们会不断地减弱。

85
00:02:58,409 --> 00:02:59,335
Because of this property
因此，由于

86
00:02:59,335 --> 00:03:00,694
of the cosmological constant,
宇宙常量所具有的性质，

87
00:03:00,694 --> 00:03:03,451
the future universe will be more and more dominated
未来的宇宙中更多充斥的

88
00:03:03,451 --> 00:03:04,592
by dark energy,
将是暗能量，

89
00:03:04,592 --> 00:03:06,330
becoming colder and colder
宇宙将会变得越来越冷

90
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:08,715
and expanding faster and faster.
其膨胀速度也会越来越快。

91
00:03:08,715 --> 00:03:10,736
Eventually, the universe will run out of gas
最终，宇宙将会由于缺少气体而无法

92
00:03:10,736 --> 00:03:11,842
to form stars,
形成恒星，

93
00:03:11,842 --> 00:03:13,941
and the stars themselves will run out of fuel
同时恒星自身也会

94
00:03:13,941 --> 00:03:15,192
and burn out,
燃烧殆尽，

95
00:03:15,192 --> 00:03:18,062
leaving the universe with only black holes in it.
宇宙中留下的只会是一个个黑洞。

96
00:03:18,062 --> 00:03:19,255
Given enough time,
如果经历足够的时间，

97
00:03:19,255 --> 00:03:21,610
even these black holes will evaporate,
即使是这些黑洞也会消失，

98
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:24,523
leaving a universe that is completely cold and empty.
那时宇宙将会是一片寒冷空虚。

99
00:03:24,523 --> 00:03:28,127
That is what we call the heat death of the universe.
那就是我们所说的宇宙热寂说。

100
00:03:28,127 --> 00:03:29,569
While it might sound depressing
尽管这听起来让人觉得

101
00:03:29,569 --> 00:03:30,694
living in a universe
生活在宇宙之中十分沮丧，

102
00:03:30,694 --> 00:03:32,735
that will end its lifetime cold
因为它将在寒冷

103
00:03:32,735 --> 00:03:34,237
and devoid of life,
和了无生气中走向灭亡，

104
00:03:34,237 --> 00:03:36,027
the end fate of our universe
但宇宙最终冰冷的消亡

105
00:03:36,027 --> 00:03:37,937
actually has a beautiful symmetry
却完美地与其

106
00:03:37,937 --> 00:03:40,087
to its hot, fiery beginning.
火热的发端相称。

107
00:03:40,087 --> 00:03:41,998
We call the accelerating end state
我们称宇宙的加速最终状态为

108
00:03:41,998 --> 00:03:44,111
of the universe a de Sitter phase,
德西特阶段，

109
00:03:44,111 --> 00:03:46,082
named after the Dutch mathematician
这是根据荷兰数学家

110
00:03:46,082 --> 00:03:47,927
Willem de Sitter.
威廉?德西特命名的。

111
00:03:47,927 --> 00:03:49,685
However, we also believe
然而，我们也相信

112
00:03:49,685 --> 00:03:51,520
that the universe had another phase
宇宙还存在另一个

113
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,831
of de Sitter expansion
德西特膨胀阶段，

114
00:03:52,831 --> 00:03:54,607
in the earliest times of its life.
它发生在宇宙形成的初期。

115
00:03:54,607 --> 00:03:57,228
We call this early period inflation,
我们称其为早期膨胀阶段，

116
00:03:57,228 --> 00:03:58,894
where, shortly after the Big Bang,
那是在大爆炸后，

117
00:03:58,894 --> 00:04:01,219
the universe expanded extremely fast
宇宙急速膨胀的

118
00:04:01,219 --> 00:04:02,860
for a brief period.
短暂时期。

119
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:04,391
So, the universe will end
因此宇宙将会以

120
00:04:04,391 --> 00:04:06,858
in much the same state as it began,
与其产生时相同的状态结束，

121
00:04:06,858 --> 00:04:08,768
accelerating.
加速。

00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:13,861
where we can start to understand
在在这样的时代我们能够去了解

125
00:04:13,861 --> 00:04:15,153
the universe's journey
宇宙的历程，

126
00:04:15,153 --> 00:04:16,437
and view a history
同时也能够去了解

127
00:04:16,437 --> 00:04:18,520
that plays itself out on the sky
它那呈现在天空中

128
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:20,622
for all of us to see.
为我们每个人所展示的历史。
