00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,000
TED:如果超能力是真的
If superpowers were real

2
00:00:13,692 --> 00:00:15,603
If you wake up one morning
如果某天早上你醒来

3
00:00:15,603 --> 00:00:19,630
with 1,000 times the strength you had the night before,
发现你的力量是昨晚的一千倍，

4
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:23,909
how will you handle delicate day-to-day tasks?
你该如何处理那些日常的精细活？

5
00:00:23,909 --> 00:00:26,282
Everything must seem so fragile to you
一切对于你来说都太脆弱了

6
00:00:26,282 --> 00:00:27,739
since the scale of your strength
因为你的力量

7
00:00:27,739 --> 00:00:31,172
has expanded one thousand times.
已经扩大为原来的一千倍。

8
00:00:31,172 --> 00:00:32,868
You'd have to be very careful
你必须非常的小心

9
00:00:32,868 --> 00:00:34,492
when you're shaking someone's hand
这样当你和别人握手的时候

10
00:00:34,492 --> 00:00:35,998
so you don't end up breaking their bones
才不至于把他们的骨头捏碎

11
00:00:35,998 --> 00:00:38,998
or crushing everyone you hug.
或者把每个你拥抱的人给挤死。

12
00:00:41,089 --> 00:00:43,344
And using a fork to pick up a piece of broccoli
此外， 用餐叉从一个泡沫塑料盘子里

13
00:00:43,344 --> 00:00:44,436
from a Styrofoam plate
叉起一块西兰花

14
00:00:44,436 --> 00:00:46,396
without driving the fork through the plate
而不叉透盘子，

15
00:00:46,396 --> 00:00:51,276
is going to be as difficult as brain surgery.
这难度将不亚于脑外科手术。

16
00:00:51,276 --> 00:00:52,420
Say the day comes
如果真的有这么一天

17
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:55,283
and you get the chance to save a damsel in distress
你正好有机会去拯救一个正在

18
00:00:55,283 --> 00:00:57,659
falling from a helicopter.
从直升飞机上落下而身处险境中的少女。

19
00:01:00,432 --> 00:01:01,734
So, you hold out your arms,
你伸出你的双臂，

20
00:01:01,734 --> 00:01:02,994
hoping to catch her.
希望能接住她。

21
00:01:02,994 --> 00:01:05,016
Seconds later, you will find yourself
几秒之后，你却发现

22
00:01:05,016 --> 00:01:07,688
holding her lifeless body.
你抱着的是她的尸体。

23
00:01:07,688 --> 00:01:08,681
What happened?
这是怎么回事？

24
00:01:08,681 --> 00:01:11,552
Well, pressure is force divided by area.
其实，压强等于压力除以受力面积。

25
00:01:11,552 --> 00:01:12,791
The smaller the area,
受力面积越小，

26
00:01:12,791 --> 00:01:13,996
the bigger the pressure.
压强就越大。

27
00:01:13,996 --> 00:01:15,883
This is why we can lift heavy objects
这就是为什么我们能抬起重物

28
00:01:15,883 --> 00:01:17,429
without breaking our skin,
却不会伤到皮肤，

29
00:01:17,429 --> 00:01:19,169
but a tiny needle can make us bleed
但一个小小的针头只要轻轻扎一下

30
00:01:19,169 --> 00:01:21,889
with just a little poke.
就能让我们出血。

31
00:01:21,889 --> 00:01:23,968
The pressure that will be exerted on her body
作用到她身上的压强

32
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:25,845
can be calculated by force
可以通过压力

33
00:01:25,845 --> 00:01:28,478
divided by the area on the top of your arms
除以你双臂上表面与她身体发生接触

34
00:01:28,478 --> 00:01:29,871
that comes in contact with her.
的面积来得出。

35
00:01:29,871 --> 00:01:31,623
It doesn't matter if your arms are strong enough
这和你双臂是否强壮到

36
00:01:31,623 --> 00:01:34,068
to catch her body without breaking your bones.
能接住她的身体而不骨折没有关系。

37
00:01:34,068 --> 00:01:35,249
Her spine is not strong enough
问题是她的脊椎不够强壮，

38
00:01:35,249 --> 00:01:37,939
to be caught by you without being damaged.
无法保证被你接住而不受损。

39
00:01:37,939 --> 00:01:39,619
Even if you rip off the nearest door
就算你就近拆下一扇门

40
00:01:39,619 --> 00:01:41,872
to provide a bigger area to catch her with,
来提供一个更大的表面积来接住她，

41
00:01:43,932 --> 00:01:46,893
you still wouldn't be able to save her anyway.
你也还是无法救她一命。

42
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:50,144
Remember, it's not the fall that kills her,
记住，她不是因为下落而死，

43
00:01:50,144 --> 00:01:52,844
but the sudden stop at the bottom.
而是因为落到地面后的骤然静止。

44
00:01:52,844 --> 00:01:55,138
Let's say she's falling from a 32 story building,
比如说她正在从32层楼上落下，

45
00:01:55,138 --> 00:01:56,229
about 300 feet,
差不多300英尺，

46
00:01:56,229 --> 00:01:57,550
and you are 6 feet tall,
而你有6英尺高，

47
00:01:57,550 --> 00:01:59,228
maybe 10 feet on your tippy-toes,
可能踮起脚尖有10英尺高，

48
00:01:59,228 --> 00:02:00,417
with your arms above your head
你双臂将一扇门

49
00:02:00,417 --> 00:02:01,252
holding a door,
举过头顶，

50
00:02:01,252 --> 00:02:02,601
in hopes of distributing the pressure
期望能够将压力分散作用于

51
00:02:02,601 --> 00:02:04,678
across a larger surface area,
一个更大的表面积上，

52
00:02:04,678 --> 00:02:06,240
but all you're doing is essentially moving
但实际上你所做的只是把

53
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,647
the ground up by 10 feet.
着陆点抬高了10英尺。

54
00:02:08,647 --> 00:02:10,932
So, she's now falling from 290 feet,
等于她现在是从290英尺落下，

55
00:02:10,932 --> 00:02:12,439
instead of 300 feet,
而不是300英尺，

56
00:02:12,439 --> 00:02:14,699
reaching the speed of 173 feet per second
这样她在落地时的速度

57
00:02:14,699 --> 00:02:16,515
just before impact,
可以达到173英尺每秒，

58
00:02:16,515 --> 00:02:18,453
not counting air resistance.
不考虑空气阻力的话。

59
00:02:18,453 --> 00:02:21,097
It's the equivalent of crashing at 94 miles per hour
这相当于以94英里每小时的速度

60
00:02:21,097 --> 00:02:24,347
into a wall with a door in front of it.
顶着它前面的一扇门撞进墙里。

61
00:02:27,684 --> 00:02:30,538
The only thing that could save her is flying.
这时只有会飞才能救她。

62
00:02:30,538 --> 00:02:34,158
But that power comes with its own host of scientific issues.
但随之而来的是一系列与其相关的重要科学问题。

63
00:02:34,158 --> 00:02:36,334
If you could fly,
假如你会飞，

64
00:02:36,334 --> 00:02:38,602
what you must do is fly up to her,
你必须飞上去接住她，

65
00:02:38,602 --> 00:02:40,848
start flying down at the speed she is falling,
然后以她下落的速度往下飞，

66
00:02:40,848 --> 00:02:42,087
hold on to her,
抱紧她，

67
00:02:42,087 --> 00:02:43,784
then gradually slow down
然后慢慢减速

68
00:02:43,784 --> 00:02:45,842
until you come to a complete stop.
直到完全停住。

69
00:02:48,272 --> 00:02:50,400
This process requires a lot of cushion space
这个过程要求在她开始下落的地点到地面之间

70
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,189
between the point she starts falling and the ground.
有一个很大的缓冲空间。

71
00:02:53,189 --> 00:02:54,219
Every second you waste
你每多浪费一秒钟

72
00:02:54,219 --> 00:02:56,836
on changing into your superhero costume
去换你的超级英雄战袍

73
00:02:56,836 --> 00:02:58,252
and flying up to her height,
然后飞到她所处的高度，

74
00:02:58,252 --> 00:03:01,068
her head is getting that much closer to the pavement!
她的头离地面的距离会越来越近！

75
00:03:01,068 --> 00:03:02,529
If she's falling from a high place,
如果她从一个很高的地方落下来，

76
00:03:02,529 --> 00:03:03,695
and you can't get to her
而你却在

77
00:03:03,695 --> 00:03:05,442
until she's only a few feet above the ground,
她离地面仅有几英尺的时候才接住她，

78
00:03:05,442 --> 00:03:07,289
there's really nothing you can do
那么，你也无能为力了

79
00:03:07,289 --> 00:03:10,032
other than magically turn the pavement
除非你能神奇的将坚硬的路面

80
00:03:10,032 --> 00:03:11,012
into marshmellow
变成棉花糖

81
00:03:11,012 --> 00:03:14,340
to allow her enough time to slowly come to a stop.
让她能有足够的时间慢慢停下来。

82
00:03:16,894 --> 00:03:19,059
Then, break out the chocolate and graham crackers
那么，拿出巧克力和全麦饼干

83
00:03:19,059 --> 00:03:21,148
and you've got s'mores.
你就已经可以做“棉花糖巧克力夹心饼干”了。

84
00:03:21,148 --> 00:03:22,949
Mmmm, delicious!
嗯，好吃！

85
00:03:26,642 --> 00:03:29,282
Now, which superpower physics lesson
现在，你打算接着选择

86
00:03:29,282 --> 00:03:31,551
will you explore next?
哪门超能力物理课去研究？

87
00:03:31,551 --> 00:03:35,945
Shifting body size and content,
是改变人体大小和成分,

88
00:03:35,945 --> 00:03:37,341
super speed,

92
00:03:44,456 --> 00:03:46,256
and
还是

93
00:03:46,256 --> 00:03:49,252
invisibility.
隐身。
